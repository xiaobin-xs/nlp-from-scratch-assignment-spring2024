Student Speaker Prithu Pareek Prithu Pareek is a senior at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and currently serving as the President of the Undergraduate Student Senate. Originally from the Washington, D.C,. area, he is passionate about creating a more equitable and accessible world for people with disabilities through new assistive technologies and policies. This passion is fueled by his personal experiences living with muscular dystrophy. Prithu has had the opportunity to conduct research in human-robot interaction and assistive robotics at CMU and the Naval Research Laboratories in D.C. As part of this research, he recently developed a new motion planning algorithm that allows multi-armed robots to more safely and efficiently complete tasks in uncertain environments. Before this, he researched treatments for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy at Boston Children's Hospital. Prithu has a zeal for advocacy, working on several initiatives while serving as a Student Senator. As Chair of the Senate Business Affairs Committee, he successfully led an initiative to improve the hourly student worker experience and raise the campus-wide minimum wage from $8.25 to $10 an hour and successfully advocated for a campus-wide day of service holiday on Election Day. After CMU, he will be working in the Bay Area as a motion planning engineer at Aurora, an autonomous vehicle company.
