4 Carnegie Mellon Code 
Students at Carnegie Mellon, because they are members of an academic community dedicated to 
the achievement of excellence, are expected to m eet the highest standards of personal, ethical 
and moral conduct possible. 
These standards require personal  integrity, a commitment to honesty without compromise, as 
well as truth without equivocation and a willingne ss to place the good of the community above 
the good of the self. Obligations once un dertaken must be me t, commitments kept. 
As members of the Carnegie Mellon community , individuals are expected to uphold the 
standards of the community in a ddition to holding others accountable for said standards. It is 
rare that the life of a student in an academic community can be so private that it will not affect the community as a whole or that the above standards do not apply. 
The discovery, advancement, and communicatio n of knowledge are not possible without a 
commitment to these standards. Creativity cannot exist without acknowledgment of the 
creativity of others. New knowledge cannot be developed without credit  for prior knowledge. 
Without the ability to trust that these princ iples will be observed, an academic community 
cannot exist. 
The commitment of its faculty, staff, and students to these standards contributes to the high 
respect in which the Carnegie Mellon degree is he ld. Students must not de stroy that respect by 
8 
 their failure to meet these standards. Stud ents who cannot meet them should voluntarily 
withdraw from the university. 
The Carnegie Mellon Code can also be found online . 
5 University Policies and Expectations

8.1 The MSAII Degree 
The M.S. in Artificial Intelli gence and Innovation (MSAII) is a professional master's program 
offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) in the School of Computer Science at 
Carnegie Mellon University. This program seeks to educate students in the innovative use of 
artificial intelligence to create practical soluti ons in a wide variety of application areas. As 
artificial intelligence matures, th ere is a great need for students who can envision, design, plan 
and deliver solutions that integrate AI technolo gies such as deep learning, natural language 
processing, robotics and big data analytics into  new applications.  The program stresses both 
10 
 intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship and enco urages students to develop ideas for startups 
and for introduction into established companies. 
The curriculum is designed for students who have  a strong background in computer science 
with interest in in-depth study of AI to ena ble them to develop re al-world applications, 
especially in areas to which AI has not yet b een applied. The integrated curriculum includes 
coursework and team projects lead ing to a full-semester capstone project to produce a working 
prototype.

8.3 The Reasonable Person Principle (RPP) 
It is a long-standing and revered principle of the School of Computer Science (SCS) that 
members of our community are expe cted to act reasonably, and ther efore we try to keep formal, 
written SCS policies to a minimum.  The faculty  do not burden the students with numerous 
rules, and, in return, we expect the students to not try to find technical  loopholes that violate 
the clear intent of program policies.  In any situa tion not covered by an ex plicit rule, you should 
ask yourself how reasonable people would behave  in that situation.  The RPP does not alter 
University-wide policies.

8.4 Academic Calendar

9 The Language Techno logies Institute

9.1 Working Space for MS Students 
Except for restrictions due to COVID, full-time students in the LTI’s MS degree programs on the 
Pittsburgh campus have access to a shared working space to create a sense of community and 
provide space for working when on campus.

9.2 Photocopies and Printers 
Mailboxes, printers, copiers, and other depa rtmental resources are located in GHC 5404 
The use of a photocopier requires only a CMU ID card.  The School of Computer Science 
provides a number of black-and-white and co lor printers for use by students.  The SCS 
Computer Facilities publishes a list of printers online at https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printing.  Wh en you send a file to  the print queue, you 
may go to any of the listed printers, swipe yo ur CMU ID, and the file will be printed on that 
printer.

9.3 Computers for MS Students 
Students are expected to provide their own laptop computers that can be used to access 
university resources and complete course assignm ents.  Laptops running  Windows, MacOS, and 
Linux software are all acceptable. 
MS students will be given a CS user id.  A CS us er id is required to use the LTI computer cluster, 
department printers, and other SC S services.  The School of Computer Science has a Help 
Center located at 4203 GHC.  They can be contacted at help@cs.cmu.edu , extension 8-4231 from 
a campus phone, or 412-268-4 231 from an outside line. 
MS students will be given access to the LTI’s comp uter cluster on an as-needed basis, to be used 
for course assignments, directed study projects, and/or the capstone project.  The LTI cluster 
provides storage and computation for projects  involving large datasets and/or lengthy 
computation.  
12 
 10 Degree Requirements 
MSAII students are expected to complete their degr ee requirements within five consecutive semesters, 
fall, spring, summer internship, second fall, second sp ring.  Under exceptional conditions, such as for 
medical reasons, a student may be granted a leave of absence.  See Section 11.1.10, below.   Upon 
completion of the graduate program degree requirem ents, the degree will be certified by the student’s 
academic program in the semester in whic h the student completes the requirements .

10.1 Course Grade and GPA Requirements   
To receive the M.S. degree, all students  must take and successfully complete at least 195 units 
of coursework . All required Core Courses must be completed with a grade of B or better . For 
the Knowledge Area Courses, students must maintain a B average .  No grade lower than C (or 
Pass in the case of Pass/No Pass courses) shall be used for credit appli ed toward graduation.  
Under SCS policy, only a grade of C or higher will be regarded as a Pass in a Pass/No Pass 
course.  No undergraduat e courses count toward the 195-unit requirement. 
All Core courses are organized in sequence, and must be taken in the following order: 
 Artificial Intelligence and Future Markets (11-651) – No prerequisite. 
 AI Engineering (11-695) – Prerequisite is the co mpletion of 11-651 with a grade of “B” or 
better. 
 LTI Practicum (11-935) – Three credit units for completing the required Internship. 
 AI Innovation (11-654) – Prereq uisite is the completion of 11- 695 with a grade of “B” or 
better. 
 Capstone (11-699) – Prerequisite is the completion of 11-654 with a grade of “B” or better.  
Students are required to repeat any required cour se that they have completed with a grade less 
than the required minimum, preferably at the nex t offering. (Please note that Core courses and 
Knowledge courses are only offered once per year.) Students will be  allowed to retake a required 
course only once.  If a student fails in the second attemp t, he or she will be dropped from the 
MSAII program.    
If a student fails an elective course, she or he will need to repeat the same or take a substitute 
course (equivalent course approved by the Director).    
All grades count towards the program QPA, exce pt for repeated courses, in which case the final 
grade replaces the previous grade.  Courses taken pass/no pass do not affect the student’s QPA.  
However, ONLY ELECTIVE COURSES MAY BE  TAKEN PASS/NO PASS, unless the Provost 
directs to the contrary.  Students who do not achieve the required minimum grade in a required 
course, who elect to take an “i ncomplete” in a required course, or whose cumulative grade point 
average is below a B (3.0), will be placed on academ ic probation. Students on probation are not 
eligible to graduate. Students who are placed on academic probation shall receive written  
notice of this finding, including a list of meas ures that need to be tak en to be removed from 
13 
 academic probation. A student on academic pr obation for two consecutive semesters may be 
dropped from the program.    
The MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in 
order to monitor individual student progress towa rd graduation. Should a student’s effort fall 
below the acceptable academic performance and/or fail to meet the sta ndards established by the 
MSAII program and Carnegie Mellon Universit y, the student may be dismissed from the 
program. 
Should a student’s overall QPA drop below 3.0 d uring any given semester, he/she will be placed 
on academic probation for the following semester and will be required to improve his/her grades 
to no less than overall 3.0 QPA d uring that period. Failure to im prove to an overall 3.0 QPA or 
better the following semester may result in termin ation from the program. In addition, a student 
who violates policies established by Carnegie  Mellon University may be dismissed from the 
program. 
After each academic progress revi ew, a student may receive one or  more letters, indicating the 
result of the review. Warning letters  are issued for the following cases: 
1) Overall QPA below 3.0 (Academic probation) 
2) Semester QPA is below 3.0 
3) Grade below B in a Core course 
4) Academic Integrity Violation (AIV) according to  the university policies.  This includes any 
AIV letter received in during the summer preceding matriculation. 
A student may be terminated from the program under any of the following circumstances: 
a) A student who has received two Academic  Integrity Violation (AIV) letters will  be 
terminated.  There are no exceptions  and the Program Director has no discretion over 
such a termination as it is an LTI policy. 
b) A student who has received one Academ ic Integrity Violation (AIV) letter may  be 
terminated by the Program Director if the vi olation is so serious that the student cannot 
be allowed to remain in the MSAII Program. 
c) A student has received three warning letter s of any type from the MSAII program. 
d) A student has been found to have violated a University Policy for which termination is 
provided. 
An AIV letter or violation of University Poli cy may be appealed pursuant to CMU appeal 
procedures.  See Section 4.5.2, be low.  However, a decision to te rminate a student after appeal 
because of conditions a), b), c) or d) is not appealable.

10.2 Course Requirements  
14 
 1) Summer Before Entrance  
Admitted students are required to take, pa y for, and pass 15-513 Introduction to 
Computer Systems OR 11-637 Foundations of Computational Data Science during the 
summer prior to their arrival at Carnegie Mellon.  The units earned in these courses are 
not counted toward the total number of units required for graduation.  These courses 
may be taken pass/no pass, but cannot be dr opped.  A student who drops either course 
during the summer will not be permitted to begin the degree program in the fall, but 
must retake one of the courses the following summer.   The MSAII course offerings are 
available at msaii.cs.cmu.edu/curriculum .  The university’s complete Schedule of 
Classes can be found at https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/o pen/SOC/SOCServlet/search .

      11-691, Math for Machine Learni ng, which is not being offered in Fall 2022.) 
 10-605, Machine Learning with Large Data sets (12 units).  First spring semester. 
 
11-611, Natural Language Processing (12 units).  Second fall semester. 
 11-785, Deep Learning (12 unit s).  Second spring semester. 
 One more 12-unit AI, ML or NLP course of the student’s choice (with approval of the 
Program Director) 
In the event that a course is not available, a course covering equivalent material with a 
similar degree of difficulty may be substitut ed with the permission of the Director. If a 
15 
 student has already taken an equivalent course and shows proficiency in the subject 
area, a more advanced course in the area may be taken in place of these required 
courses with permission of the Director.  Graduate students cannot receive credit for 
undergraduate courses.       
 
4) Electives:  
A minimum of 36 units of SCS courses must be taken.  It is recommended to take one 
elective in the first fall semester, one or tw o in the first spring semester, one or two in 
the second fall semester and zero or one in the second spring semester.  The courses 
below are automatically approved.  A stud ent who wants to take a course not listed 
must obtain approval of the Director prior to  registering.  In general, the Director will 
approve any graduate SCS course of not more than  12 units.  It is also possible to seek 
approval for courses in other Colleges at  CMU.  However, those courses must be 
rationally related to an AI career in order to be approved as electives.

Independent study (11-636) is encouraged.  The process is that you find a faculty 
member willing to supervise your independent study,  assign a number of credits not to 
exceed 12, and assign a grade at the end of the study.  Th e faculty member must send 
an email to the Director indicating such wi llingness.  You can then register for 11-636. 
 
Courses carrying more than 12 units in a se mester are NOT APPROVED as electives.  
 Students may take athletics or music or th eatrical performance courses that do not 
require work outside of class times.  Ho wever, such courses will NOT count toward 
the 195 units required for graduation.

10.2.1  Incomplete Grades  
Carnegie Mellon University students are expect ed to complete a course during the academic 
semester in which the course was taken. Howeve r, if the instructor agrees, a grade of “I” 
(incomplete) may be given when a student has b een unable to complete the work of a course. 
However, the work completed up to that date must be of pa ssing quality and the grade of 
incomplete provides no undue advantage to that student over other students.  
By awarding an “I” grade, an instructor must spe cify the requirements for the completion of the 
work and designate a default letter grade in th e event that the student fails to complete the 
remaining work.  
Students must complete the required course work  by no later than th e end of the following 
academic semester or sooner if  required by the instructor.  
The instructor must record the permanent cours e grade by the last day of the examination 
period of the following semester , or the Registrar will automatica lly assign the default grade.  
If further work has not been completed after o ne semester and a default grade is rendered, the 
default grade will become the grade of record.

10.2.2  Change of grades and missing grades  
If a grade has been assigned in error, it can be  changed to a different  permanent grade. The 
procedure for changing a grade is as follows: 
 Discuss the matter with the course instructor;  provide evidence th at the grade issued was 
not the grade earned. 
17 
  If the instructor agrees, the student should contact the prog ram administrator to process 
a Change of Grade Form in or der to correct the grade that was issued in error. Generally, 
the instructor is the final authority for a course grade. 
 If a grade has not been assigned, please notify  the course instructor for the completion of 
a Missing Grade Form.

10.2.3  Transferring to another program  
A student may withdraw from th e MSAII program at any time.  If any requirement for the 
MSAII degree has not been met, the degree will  not be awarded.  O ccasionally, students are 
accepted into a different degree pr ogram at CMU and transfer to that program.  International 
students who do this should ch eck with OIE to ensure that th eir visa is not jeopardized.

10.2.4  Intellectual Property Policy 
See http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/IntellProp.html .

10.2.5  Teaching Requirements 
None.  Students who wish to do  so may apply for teaching assist ant positions for courses in 
which they have excelled.  It is important to ensure that the student’s academic responsibilities 
are not adversely impacted by a TAship, and vice-versa.

10.3 Advising

10.3.1  Student Advising  
Every MSAII student will be assigned an advisor,  normally the Program Director.  Before the 
course registration period each semester, students  must meet with their advisor to discuss their 
course selection. New students wi ll be given instructions to regist er for their classes during the 
summer prior to entrance.

10.3.2  Monitoring Progress  
The advisor meets with the student at least twic e a year, providing guidance and monitoring the 
student’s overall progress.

10.3.3  Degree Certification  
Students who graduate having met all the requ irements for the degree will receive a diploma 
stating that they have received a “Master of Science in Artifici al Intelligence and Innovation.” 
18 
 10.4 Internship   
Students must obtain an internship during the summer between the first and second years of the 
program.  This is a requirement.  An internship will provide stu dents with the opportunity to 
apply the knowledge and technical skills learned d uring the first year of the program, to gain 
insight into AI and future marke t needs to further their experienc e and develop a strong context 
for the second-year concentration coursework.  No rmally the internship wi ll be with an outside 
company.  In some circumstances, a student wh o is doing research with  a CMU faculty member 
during the summer may request that such  research qualify as an internship. 
The internship must involve at le ast two months of full-time work  and must relate to computer 
software development and is preferably AI-related. 
Students are encouraged to intern with an organiza tion that corresponds to their individual area 
of interest and career goals.   
All students who secure summer internships must register for three units in 11-935 (LTI 
Practicum).  This course can be taken once du ring the program with Pass/Fail and will be 
counted toward graduation units.  Internationa l students must apply for Curricular Practical 
Training (CPT) for the internship by contacting the Office of International Education (OIE).  To 
obtain CPT, students need an offer letter spelling  out employment dates, work hours, and wages 
or stipend.  It is the student’s responsibility in 11-935 to give a presentation during the semester 
following the internship to a ll current MSAII students detailing the student’s internship 
experience. 
International students who are in terested in working in  the U.S after graduation are required to 
consult with the Office of International Educat ion (OIE) which oversees the OPT registration.  
Note: OPT must only be used after students have completed their degree at Carnegie Mellon.  
NOTE : Students are personally respon sible for securing a suitable internship.  The Career and 
Professional Development Center will assist in their search for counseling, workshops, and 
internship opportunity listings in Handshake .  We strongly suggest students begin the 
internship search beginnin g in the Fall of your first year. So me internship opportunities have 
application deadlines in the Fall,  so by starting your search ea rly, you won't miss out on these 
internships.  The Career and Pr ofessional Development Center will assist students with the 
internship search, but does not match students with employers; obtaining an internship is the 
students’ responsibility.   
The following steps are recommended to ensure a successful internship outcome.  Many of the 
events below have been modified due to COVID. 
September/October  
 Meet with your advisor to discuss your in terests and plan your internship search.  
19 
  Review the internships of previous students. We also encourage you to speak informally 
with second-year students who can offer firs t-hand information about their internships.  
 Attend the Technical Opportunities Conferenc e (TOC) at Carnegie Mellon for exposure 
to potential employers for internships.   
November/December  
 Begin researching organizations and internsh ip opportunities. Pay close attention to 
organizations that have established inte rnship programs and their deadlines.  
 Attend workshops to perfec t your resume, hone your inte rviewing skills, and gain 
knowledge about the intern ship search process.  
January/February  
 At this point, you should have a “short list” of organizations at which you would like to 
intern. This list can include organizations th at have established internship programs as 
well as those that interest you without formal internship programs. 
 Update your resume with relevant ac ademic projects, coursework, etc. 
 Begin utilizing your network for internship leads as well as checking organization’s 
websites for internships.  
 Make contact with employers, sending resume s and applications, and initiating internship 
interviews in person  or by phone.  
 Attend Network Nights and talk to alumni  about internship opportunities in their 
organization. They are an excellent resourc e for learning more about a particular 
organization, career field or employment oppo rtunity. You can find alumni in the Alumni 
Directory, Alumni Career Advisor Networ k, and Carnegie Mellon Alumni LinkedIn 
Network.  
March/April  
 At this point, you should ha ve secured an internship or be  interviewing with various 
organizations.  
 Prepare a backup plan if your first ch oices of internships do not work out. 
 Attend relevant Network Nights and Career Fairs at Carnegie Mellon.  
 If you are an F-1 Visa student, you must apply for CPT.  
 MSAII students should enroll in 11-935 for three units. You will not have to pay tuition for 
this course.

10.5 Employment Eligibility Verification  
If you are receiving compensation or a stipend from  CMU, if you are going to be a TA or you are 
planning to seek a position with CMU, then Em ployment Eligibility Verification is required.  
Form I-9 must be completed within 3 busine ss days of beginning work for any type of 
compensation (stipend or employment). Addi tional details are highlighted below. 
20 
 To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the Employment 
Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy [pdf]  covering the university’s I- 9 and E-Verify requirements:  
Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or  employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 
Policy by completing the Form I-9 within thre e business days following the first day of stipend 
start date/employment.  
Individuals who expect to work  on a federally funded projec t are further responsible for 
submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources.  
For more information, please see CMU’s Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify 
Requirements at CMU [pdf] , or visit the Human Reso urces Service website to learn more about 
Form I-9 and E-Verify  and to schedule an appointment to  complete the Form I-9.

10.6 MSAII Orientation  
Each Fall semester, the MSAII pr ogram provides a program orientation to help new students 
learn about the program. All new students are re quired to attend them and treat them seriously 
because they explain the program sequence, it s Core and Knowledge co urses requirements and 
how students will meet the program learning outcomes.

10.7 End of Semester Evaluation 
The MSAII program conducts an academic progress re view at the conclusion of each semester in 
order to monitor individual student progress towa rds graduation. Should a student’s effort fall 
below the acceptable level of academic perfor mance and/or fail to meet the standards 
established by the MSAII program, the stud ent may be dismissed from the program. 
After each academic progress revi ew, a student may receive one or  more letters, indicating the 
result of the review. See Section 3.1, Co urse Grade and GPA Requirements, above. 
At the end of the semester, the faculty evaluate s each student's academic progress. If a student 
seems to be having trouble, th e faculty determines whether it believes that the student can 
finish the degree, and if  so, what needs to be accomplished to get back on track. This type of 
letter should be considered a serious warning. It is not a permanent "black mark" on the 
student's record; if the student begins making sa tisfactory progress again, there is no official 
record of the letter in the student's transcript. 
In the most serious cases, the faculty gives the stud ent a letter that specifies a list of conditions 
that the student must satisfy by specific deadlines . Failure to meet all of the specified conditions 
may result in the student's te rmination from the program. 
21 
 10.8 Enrollment Verification 
Enrollment Services is the only University office th at can provide an official letter of enrollment, 
official transcript, and enrollment verification.  Enrollment verification can be requested online 
through The HUB at www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/student-records/transcripts/ .

10.9 University Policies on Grades and Grading

10.9.1  University Policy on Grades 
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-an d-student-life/grading.html  
 
This policy offers details concerning university grading principles for students taking courses 
and covers the specifics of assigning and changi ng grades, grading options, drop/withdrawals, 
and course repeats.  It also defines the un dergraduate and graduate grading standards.

10.9.2  University Policy on Grades for Transfer Courses & PCHE 
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student -life/transfer-credit-evaluation-and-
assignment.html   
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the o pportunity to take courses for credit through a 
cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Co uncil on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-
registration below) and through the receipt of tr ansfer credit from other accredited institutions. 
The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will in clude information on such courses as follows: 
Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken throug h the university's cross-registration program 
will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will 
be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken but without a grade. Such 
courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors  or QPA calculations. (Note: 
Suspended students may take courses elsewhere; ho wever, they may receive transfer credit only 
if their college’s and department's policies allow this.)  
The MSAII program does not accept transfer credit for courses taken prior to matriculation at 
Carnegie Mellon. 
The MSAII program does not accept  distance education credits except for distance courses 
offered by Carnegie Mello n or PCHE institutions.

10.10 Academic Integrity 
Carnegie Mellon’s Academic Integrity policy is posted at  
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and -student-life/academic-integrity.html.  All students 
22 
 are expected to be familiar with this policy, including the university-wi de protocol for handling 
academic integrity violations.  The policy incl udes the University expectations around academic 
integrity and provides definitions of cheati ng, plagiarism, and unauthorized assistance.  
A review of the University’s Academ ic Disciplinary Actions procedures 
(https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/th eword/academic-discipline/index.html ) is also 
recommended. These procedures outline the proc ess for investigating, reporting, and 
adjudicating violations of the University Policy  on Academic Integrit y. The procedures also 
outline the appeal process. 
It is an absolute requirement  that the work you submit must be your own, unless you 
specifically identify the source of any material th at is not yours.  This includes quotations and 
material from websites.  In any written work (including presentations) you MUST list any 
person other than yourself who assisted you in preparing that wo rk.  Any student who violates 
the academic integrity policy will be subject to a University review that may result in 
suspension or expulsion under University policies.  THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR, THE 
FACULTY AND THE UNIVERSITY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT OF THE 
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY.   
You are not permitted to copy material from web pages, including Wikipedia, and present them 
as your own work.  Any copied material MUST appe ar in quotation marks or italics and MUST 
be accompanied by a citation to the original source.   Failure to do this violates CMU’s Policy on 
Academic Integrity, which states, “In all academic work to be graded, the citation of all sources 
is required. … Plagiarism is defined as the use of work or concepts contributed by other 
individuals without proper attribution or citation . Unique ideas or materia ls taken from another 
source for either written or oral use must be  fully acknowledged in academic work to be 
graded.” 
It is a violation of academic integrity for you to assist anyone else in violating the policy or to 
provide your work to others to assist them.  Be cause team deliverables are the product of joint 
work, it is the responsibility of each member of  a team to ensure that all team materials have 
been produced in conformance with CMU policies. Credit cannot be given fo r work that is not a 
student’s own. Therefore, if one member of a team violates a policy, for example, by copying 
material from the Internet without indicating it s source, then no one on the team can receive 
credit for that work, even if only one studen t is directly guilty of violating the policy. 
We are aware that acts that constitute cheating  can be viewed very di fferently in different 
countries and cultures.  However, Carnegie Me llon is a U.S. university and its policies reflect 
U.S. culture.  Employers expect that students  who graduate from Carnegie Mellon have 
obtained their degree legitimately and according to Carnegie Mellon policies.  If you have any 
doubt whether proposed conduct would be consi dered cheating under Carnegie Mellon policies, 
ASK A FACULTY MEMBER OR THE DIRECTOR FIRST.   
23 
 All violations of the Academic Integrity policy MUST be reported to the University 
administration by the faculty members involved.  Copies go to the Program Director, the Head of 
the Language Technology Institute, the Associate Dean for Master’s Programs, and various 
officials at Warner Hall.   The faculty do not ha ve the option to decli ne to make a report.  The 
offending student will receive an email to inform them of an A cademic Integrity Violation (AIV). 
The email will specify the offense and the penalt y, and will inform the student of available 
appeal procedures. An AIV that is successfully appealed is erased. 
Important note:   The university policy gives a depart ment the option of “conven[ing] a 
disciplinary hearing according to the procedure s of the department/pro gram.”  The LTI has a 
“two strikes” rule.  The LTI may terminate a st udent for a first violation, depending upon the 
circumstances and severity of the violation.  The LTI always terminates  a student for a second 
violation, with no exceptions.  
11 Academic Policies

11.1 Course Registration

11.1.1 Status 
All Students must be registered for at least 48 units during each semest er. Any questions about 
registration should be directed  to the Enrollment Serv ices (the HUB). Note that International 
students are required to be re gistered as full-time students, minimum 36 units .

11.1.2 Academic Calendar  
The Academic Calendar can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/calendar/ .   All dates about 
registration, add/drop deadlines, university ho lidays and more can be  found there.

11.1.3 Online Registration  
All new students will register for required courses in Apri l after accepting admission and 
receiving an Andrew ID. After that, students wi ll register following th e schedule set by the 
HUB. Note that students must meet with thei r advisor to obtain approval for their course 
selection. Registration information is available at 
www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/registration/index.html .  Online registration is done with an 
Andrew ID at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/sio/about.html .   
Students must register for at le ast 48 units per semester.   
24 
 11.1.4 Double-Dipping 
An MSAII student who applies courses taken as part of another degree program (at Carnegie 
Mellon or elsewhere) toward their program requ irements cannot use those same courses toward 
any other M.S. degree offered by the School of Computer Science without prior approval.

11.1.5 Pass/No Pass Courses (Pass/Fail) 
With the approval of the Program Director , a graduate student may choose to take one 
ELECTIVE course pass/no pass. Core courses an d Knowledge courses may not be taken pass/no 
pass.  By the deadline for changing a course to  pass/no pass, the student must fill out the 
Pass/No Pass Approval Form and receive permissio n from their advisor. A pass/no pass election 
is irrevocable as a matter of CMU policy. (A form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )

11.1.6 Auditing a Course  
With the approval of the Program Director, a gr aduate student may audit a course by obtaining 
the permission of the instructor or teaching department and completi ng the Course Audit 
Approval Form. Audited classes are not taken for credit and cannot be used to fulfill graduation 
requirements. (Audit form can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )

11.1.7 Adding a Course  
During the ADD period of each se mester (the first two weeks of the semester), students may add 
a course by registering online. After the ADD dead line, they may add a course by completing the 
Late Add Request form and obta ining the permission of both: 1) the instructor or teaching 
department and 2) their advisor.  (Add form can be found at 
https://www.cmu.edu/hub/forms.html )

11.1.8 Dropping a Course  
Dropping courses is not recommended except for reas ons of health or fami ly emergency.  Many 
SCS courses have long waitlist s, and dropping a course means that some other student who 
might have had the opportunity to take the course had been denied that ability.  Also, if students 
in the MSAII program drop courses, then the inst ructors of those courses may no longer allow 
MSAIIs to enroll. 
Sometimes, however, a student’s workload can  become unexpectedly heavy because of course 
requirements.  No one is expected to suffer from such pressure a nd dropping a course may 
become a necessity.  To avoid this unfortunate circumstance, yo u should inform yourself in 
advance of the curriculum and workload in each co urse you plan to take and ensure that you are 
capable of handling the load.  Note that CMU SCS courses are very di fficult, and students who 
25 
 may easily have handled taking five courses sim ultaneously at another institution may not be 
able to do so at CMU. 
Exact add, drop and withdrawal dates may be fou nd on the official Academic Calendar. Up until 
the deadlines, students can initiate course adds and drops through Student Information Online 
(SIO). Courses dropped by the deadline will not appear on the student's record, and courses 
withdrawn from by the deadline will receive a 'W ' grade. Additionally, a voucher process has 
been implemented for late drops. 
Students taking undergraduate and Master’s level courses must follow the procedures and 
deadlines for adding, dropping, or withdrawing from courses as identified on the academic 
calendar. Information can be found at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-
changes/index.html . 
Late Course Drops & Vouchers 
A late drop voucher system was implemented begi nning with the fall 2018 semester to permit a 
limited number of late course drops. Master's st udents are permitted one drop voucher per year 
of study and may use only one voucher per se mester (including summer).  Courses dropped 
using a voucher will be removed from the student' s record, as long as the drop is confirmed in 
SIO by the student within 24 hours of rece iving the automated voucher email (refer to 
instructions below). Students may use drop vouche rs up until the last day of classes each 
semester.  These policies are spelled out at https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/course-
changes/index.html . 
Note that the Core courses and some Knowledg e courses are only offe red once per year so 
dropping a course may delay program completion.  
Note:  International students must maintain a minimu m of 36 units (Full time) to meet the U.S. 
government’s visa requirement. Please check with  the Office of International Education (OIE) 
for more information.

11.1.9 Transfer Credits  
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/st udent-and-student-life/trans fer-credit-evaluation-and- 
assignment.html 
Carnegie Mellon University offers students the o pportunity to take courses for credit through a 
cross-registration program (see Pittsburgh Co uncil on Higher Education (PCHE) and Cross-
registration below) and through the receipt of tr ansfer credit from other accredited institutions. 
The Carnegie Mellon University transcript will in clude information on such courses as follows: 
Carnegie Mellon courses and courses taken throug h the university's cross-registration program 
will have grades recorded on the transcript and be factored into the QPA. All other courses will 
be recorded on this transcript indicating where the course was taken, but without grades. Such 
26 
 courses will not be taken into account for academic actions, honors  or QPA calculations. (Note: 
suspended students may take courses elsewhere; ho wever, they may receive transfer credit only 
if their college's and department's policies allow this.). 
The MSAII program does not accept transfer credits.

11.1.10  Leave of Absence  
Students who need to delay their studies for pers onal, medical or academic reasons may do so 
with a leave of absence (leaving the universit y temporarily with a co mmitment to return). 
Students must contact the MSAII Director to discuss their plans and fill out the appropriate form.  The student’s place in the program will be  held until a mutually  determined time. For 
more information refer to www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/student-leave.html . 
When planning to return from Leave of Abs ence students must complete the appropriate 
paperwork before returnin g to the University.   
MSAII students who require longer than the standard time to complete their degree 
requirements are expected to remain in close contact  with the program, and will be certified at 
the end of the semester in which they have co mpleted their degree requirements. Students must 
refer to the CMU Policy on Master ’s Student Statute of Limitations 
(https://www.cmu.edu/policies/ student-and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-
limitations.html ) regarding guidelines and restrictions  which place an upper limit on the 
maximum length of time allowable for maste r’s degree completion and certification.

11.1.11  Additional Guidance for Students   
Program of study . Students seeking guidance about their program of study and degree 
requirements should consult with their academic  advisor and/or appropriate associate dean.  
Financial aid and student account.  Students are expected to make normal progress toward 
their degree in order to graduate within the st andard timeframe for their program of study. 
Under U.S. Federal Title IV regulations, student eligibility for federal financial aid is contingent 
upon enrollment in and successful completion of courses that are counted as credit toward their 
current degree program. To receive the maximum amount of federal financial aid for which they 
may be eligible, students must enroll each semester  in at least 36 units that count toward their 
current degree level. (See separate guidance  regarding integrated degree completion.)  
Students should consult with their designated co llege liaison in The HU B regarding billing and 
financial aid, particularly for early completion , longer-than-standard completion, or integrated 
undergraduate and master’s degree programs.  
International students . Immigration status for students in  F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status is 
tied to making normal progress toward completing  degree requirements. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 
27 
 students who are considering completing their de gree requirements early, anticipating longer-
than-standard completion, or moving from an un dergraduate to a graduate student classification 
(integrated undergraduate-graduate study) should  consult with their designated advisor in the 
Office of International Education (OIE) to ens ure compliance with immigration regulations.

11.1.12  Withdrawal   
Students who need to withdraw from the program (leave the university with no intention of 
returning) for personal, medical or academic reasons must contact the MSAII Director to 
discuss their plans and fill out the appropri ate form. For more information refer to 
www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and- student-life/student-leave.html .

11.2 Tuition and Fees   
Information about tuition and fees is available at https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/index.html .  
MSAII students will pay tuition according to the ra tes set for the School of Computer Science.  
All tuition and fees must be paid in full by the due date; a student not in good financial standing 
will be dismissed from the program. Students ta king summer courses must pay tuition.

11.3 Graduation Ceremonies   
The University holds one Commencement ceremony in May of each year.  Only students who 
have completed their degree requirem ents may participate in Commencement. 
There are no August or December commencement ceremonies.

11.3.1 Withdrawal of Degree 
A degree once conferred can be withdrawn by the University under certain circumstances.  See 
the Withdrawal of Degree Policy .

11.4 LTI Academic Policies

11.4.1 “Grandfather” policy 
A student can graduate under the policies in effect at the time that the student entered the 
program; or, at the student's choice, the student  can graduate under policies that are adopted 
after the student entered the program. If it is no t realistic to follow a particular policy exactly, 
the department may approximate the policy as closely as possible; this situation is rare and 
typically arises only when a student is enrolled in the program for an extended period.

 11.4.2  Definition of transfer credit  versus course exemption  
The LTI may grant transfer credit  or issue an exemption  for equivalent graduate courses 
previously completed at another institution. This decision rests with the program director, on 
the advice of the faculty memb er for whose course an exempt ion is sought. If a student is 
exempt  from a required course due to  prior courses or experience, the student can replace that 
course with an open elective. The student does  not receive credit for the exempted course but 
can take any course that could normally count toward the degree in its place. If a student 
receives credit  for prior coursework completed at Car negie Mellon or elsewhere, the student 
receives that many units of credit and the to tal amount of required coursework is reduced by 
that amount.

11.4.3  Employment/Consulting 
Since consulting provides useful experience, stu dents are generally permitted to consult at most 
one day per seven-day week, with the Program Di rector's consent.  International students must 
also have approval in advance from the Office  of International Educat ion (OIE) for any paid 
position.  Students may use their consulting time to perform unpa id work on research projects 
for CMU faculty for up to 10 hours per week. 
Students may serve as teaching assistants for CMU faculty.   TA work is inconsistent with 
research because of the necessary time commitm ent.  Students must choose one activity or the 
other, not both. 
Note that there is an English language proficienc y requirement for TAs.  Graduate students are 
required to have a certain level of  fluency in English before they can instruct in Pennsylvania, as 
required by the English Fluency in Higher Ed ucation Act of 1990. Through this Act, all 
institutions of higher educatio n in the state are required to ev aluate and certify the English 
fluency of all instructional personnel, includ ing teaching assistants and interns. The full 
university policy can be reviewed at: https://www.cmu.edu/polic ies/faculty/evaluation-
certification-english-fluency-instructors.html .

11.4.4  Leave of Absence 
The LTI discourages Leaves of Absence (LOA) since students usually do not return, despite 
having good intentions. However,  a student in good standing may  be granted a LOA of at most 
one year, upon written request to the MSAII Dire ctor and with the consent of the student's 
advisor. It is the responsibility of  the student on LOA to contact th e LTI to initiate a return to 
the program. 
Students taking or returning from a leave of absence must follow the university’s leave of 
absence process, which is described at www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-
life/student-leave.html.  
29 
 11.4.5  Satisfactory Progress 
If a student  does not make satisfactory progress each se mester toward completing the degree, the 
LTI may remove the student from the program.  See section on “End of Semester Evaluation.”

11.5 Carnegie Mellon Academic Policies

11.5.1 Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities 
The Office of Disability Resources at Carneg ie Mellon University has a continued mission to 
provide physical and programmatic campus access to all events and information within the 
Carnegie Mellon community.  We work to ensure that qualified individuals receive reasonable 
accommodations as guaranteed by the Americans wi th Disabilities Act (ADA) and Sections 503 
and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  St udents who would like to receive accommodations 
must submit a Voluntary Disclosure of Disability Form  to access@andrew.cmu.edu  to begin the 
interactive accommodation process.   
For more information, please see https://www.cmu.edu/disability-resources/ .Students with 
physical, sensory, cognitive, or  emotional disabilities are enco uraged to self-identify with the 
Office of Disability Resources  and request needed accommodation s.  Any questions about the 
process can be directed to access@andr ew.cmu.edu, or call (412) 268-6121.

11.5.2  Summary of Graduate Student A ppeal and Grievance Procedures 
Students who believe that they ha ve been inappropriately treated are encouraged to raise their 
concern(s) with the Program Director, department  head, or other designa ted person in their 
department, college, or central administration accord ing to University policies.  No effort will be 
made to prevent or discourage anyone from availing themselves of such procedures (see Graduate Student Appeal and Procedures www.cmu.edu/graduate/poli cies/appeal-grievance-
procedures.html ). 
Graduate students will find the Summary of  Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance 
Procedures on the Graduate Education Reso urce web page.   This document summarizes 
processes available to graduate students who se ek review of academic and non-academic issues. 
Graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable 
department, unit or program before invoking fo rmal processes. When an informal resolution 
cannot be reached, however, a gr aduate student who seeks furthe r review of the matter is to 
follow the formal procedures outlined here.   Th ese appeal and grievanc e procedures shall apply 
to students in all graduate programs of the Univ ersity. Students should refer to the department 
specific information in this handbook for dep artment and college information about the 
administration and academic policies of the prog ram.  Additionally, students may confer with 
30 
 the Graduate Education Office ( grad-ed@cmu.edu ) on issues of process or other concerns as 
they navigate conflicts.

11.5.3  Process for Appealing Final Grades 
https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/policies /appeal-grievance-procedures.html .  
Final grades will be changed only in exceptiona l circumstances and only with the approval of 
the instructor and the department, unit or prog ram. Grading is a matter of  sound discretion of 
the instructor and final grades are rarely ch anged without the consent of the instructor who 
assigned the grade.  The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a 
grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a cours e is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error 
such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), 
or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University 
policy

11.5.4  Safeguarding Educational Equity: 
Policy Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault 
The University prohibits sex-based discriminati on, sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating/ 
domestic violence and stalking. The University al so prohibits retaliation against individuals 
who bring forward such concerns or allegation s in good faith.  The University’s Sexual 
Misconduct Policy is available at www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-
governance/sexual-harassment-and-sexual-assault.html .   If you believe you have been the victim 
of sexual harassment or sexual assault, you ar e encouraged to make contact with any of the 
following resources: 
 Office of Title IX Initiatives, http://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/ , 412-268-7125 
 Sexual Harassment Advisors, found in A ppendix A of the Policy Against Sexual 
Harassment and Sexual Assault; 
 Survivor Support Network, found in A ppendix B of the Policy Against Sexual 
Harassment and Sexual Assault; 
 Sexual Harassment Process and Title IX Coordina tors, found in section II of the Policy 
Against Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault; 
 University Police, 412-268-2323 
 University Health Services, 412-268-2157 
 Counseling & Psychological Services, 412-268-2922 
31 
 Additional resources and information can be found at :  https://www.cmu.edu/title-ix/resources-
and-information/resources.html . 
The University’s Policy Against Retaliation is available at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrati ve-and-governance/whistleblower.html  
The MSAII program has a ZERO TOLERANCE  policy on sexual harassment and sexual assault. 
If you are found to have violated Carnegie Mell on policy, you will be dropped from the MSAII 
program immediately without exception .  CMU has spent decades successfully developing a 
non-threatening environment for all genders and no one will be permitted to  interfere with that 
accomplishment. 
Consensual Intimate Relationship Poli cy Regarding Undergraduate Students 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-s tudent-life/consensual-relationships.html  
This policy is relevant for graduate students who will be in a supervisory role of undergraduate 
students as a TA or in a research lab/studio se tting.  This policy addresses the circumstances in 
which romantic, sexual or amorous relationships/ interactions with undergraduate students, 
even if consensual, are inappropriate and prohib ited. The purpose of this policy is to assure 
healthy professional relationships. This policy is not intended to discoura ge consensual intimate 
relationships unless there is a conflicting profe ssional relationship in  which one party has 
authority over the other as in the policy.

11.5.5  Cultural Tolerance 
The MSAII program is extremely diverse for a pr ogram of its size. We have students from 
numerous different countries who must work effectively in a team se tting.  The students 
invariably come from very different cultures that  have differing attitudes  towards age, gender, 
and group interaction.  The program management understands this, but th e students must also 
recognize that this program is being conducted in  the United States and operates according to 
U.S. norms.  Students and faculty,  regardless of background, age, or rank, must deal with each 
other respectfully without insult or raised voices .  It is impossible to conduct teamwork in any 
other way.  Violations will be dealt with harshly.  The Program Director is not sympathetic to 
such behavior, which will not be tolerated.  Re peated infractions, or a serious single infraction 
may result in termination from the program.

11.5.6  Language Policy 
The MSAII program is a component of the Language  Technologies Institute, which studies and 
celebrates the diversity of human language and fo rms of expression.  The LTI also recognizes the 
futility and unfairness of attempting to det ermine the language students must use when 
communicating.  However, it is unprofessional in any official team meeting to speak a language 
32 
 that is not understood by all team members.  Fo r example, if all members of a team understand 
Chinese, then they may use Chi nese in team meetings.  However,  if even one team member does 
not understand Chinese, then a language must be us ed that is understood by all team members.  
It is recommended that non-native speakers of Eng lish use English as much as possible if they 
intend to seek employment in  an English-speaking country.

11.5.7  Childbirth/Maternity Accommodation Protocol 
The Maternity Policy is available at https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-
services/maternity-accommodation-protocol.html . 
Students whose anticipated delivery date is duri ng the course of the semester may consider 
taking time away from their coursework and re search responsibilities. All female students who 
give birth to a child while engaged in coursework or  research are eligible to take either a short-
term absence or formal leave of absence. St udents in course work should consider either 
working with their course instructor to receive in complete grades or elect to drop to part-time 
status or to take a semester leave of absence.   Students engaged in research must work with 
their faculty to develop plans for the re search for the time  they are away.  
● Students must contact the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs to register for Maternity 
Accommodations. Students will complete an info rmation form and meet with a member of the 
Dean’s Office staff to determine resources and procedures appropriate for the individual student. 
○ Planning for the student’s discussio n with appropriate academic contact(s) 
(advisor, associate dean, etc.) may be reviewed during this meeting. 
● Students in course work should consider op tions for the semester of the anticipated 
birth such as working with their course instructo rs to receive incomplete grades, electing to 
drop to part-time status or taking  a full semester leave of absence. 
● Students engaged in research  must work with their facu lty to develop plans for the 
research for the time they are aw ay and for resuming upon return. 
● Master's students who receive an academ ic stipend funded by Carnegie Mellon are 
eligible to continue to receive stipend funding for up to six (6) week s during a Short-Term 
Maternity Accommodation or a Formal Leave of Absence. Continued academic stipend funding may be extended by two (2) weeks, for a total of eight (8) weeks, if an absence longer than six 
weeks is medically necessary. To receive this supp ort students must be registered with the 
Office of the Dean of Students. 
Students are encouraged to consult with relevant university facu lty and staff as soon as possible 
as they begin making plans regarding time away.   Students must contact the Office of the Dean 
of Student Affairs to register for Maternity Accommodations.  Students will complete an 
information form and meet with a member of De an’s Office staff to determine resources and 
33 
 procedures appropriate for the i ndividual student. Planning fo r the student’s discussion with 
her academic contact(s) (advisor, associate dean, etc.) will be reviewed during this meeting.

11.6 Statute of Limitations 
As outlined in the Master’s Students Statute of Limitations, www.cmu.edu/policies/student-
and-student-life/masters-students-statute-of-limitations.html , students must complete all 
requirements for the master’s degree within  a maximum of seven years from original 
matriculation as a master’s student, or less if re quired by a more restrictive department, school 
or college policy.  Once this time-to-degree li mit has lapsed, the person may resume work 
towards a master’s degree only if newly admitted  to a currently offered master’s degree program 
under criteria determined by that program. 
Under extraordinary circumstances, such as leave of absence, military or public service, family or 
parental leave, or temporary disability, a school or college may, upon the relevant department's 
recommendation and with the written approval of the dean (or designate), defer the lapse for a 
period commensurate with the duration of that  interruption. Students who are pursuing a 
master’s degree as part-time students for all seme sters of their program,  as approved by their 
program, may also appeal to their program or department for extension of the time to degree 
limit.  
Any request for a waiver of the statute of limita tions must be approved by  the Department Head 
and by the SCS Associate Dean for Masters Programs. The waiver request must explain the 
exceptional circumstances that wa rrant an extension. For cases in which a waiver is granted, 
the waiver will cover specific courses and will specify a time period for completion of the 
program. 
See also the ‘Duration of Study’ policy.

11.7 Residency Requirement 
The MSAII is a full-time, in-resid ence program conducted only on the Pittsburgh campus.  In 
exceptional circumstances, such as visa compli cations or medical exigencies, permission may be 
granted by the Director allowing a student to participate in short portions of the program 
remotely.  This is not possible for first-year students. 
12 Financial Issues

12.1 Graduate Student Funding  
34 
 The LTI does not provide financial aid or support to students in the professional MS programs.  
Students are encouraged to seek financial aid and s upport from other sources.  The HUB website 
(https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html ) provides the Graduate Financial 
Aid Guide, information about funding options and how to apply for fi nancial aid and other 
helpful links.  Additional information on financial issues  for graduate students can be found on 
the web at www.cmu.edu/hub/new-grad/ . 
Students in the professional MS  programs are not prohibited from seeking support as Teaching 
Assistants and Research Assistants.  However, typi cally full-time MS students do not have time 
for these activities.  Typically Research Assistants hips are most likely to be awarded to students 
in Carnegie Mellon’s research-oriented degree programs.

12.2 University Financial Aid 
Graduate students should consu lt the graduate student financia l aid information found on The 
HUB website: www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html .  Students will find the 
Graduate Financial Aid Guide, in formation about funding options and how to apply for financial 
aid and other helpful links.

12.3 Health Insurance  
Carnegie Mellon has a Student Health Insurance policy requiring full-time, degree-seeking 
students to carry adequate medical  insurance. Students must either  purchase the plan offered by 
the University or an application for a waiver can be made if the stud ent is “enrolled as the 
dependent, partner/spouse or principal in an employer or government-sponsored insurance 
plan” (see the Carnegie Mellon University Student Health Insurance Policy at 
https://www.cmu.edu/policies/ student-and-student-life/stu dent-health-insurance.html ).  
It is the responsibility of each student to make arrangements with Student  Health Services to 
either pay for their insurance at the beginning of  the semester, or elect a payment plan over the 
course of the academic year. More information is available at the Student Health Services Web 
site www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/ .

12.4 Emergency Loans
