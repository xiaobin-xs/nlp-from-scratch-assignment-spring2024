Notes:
*Students taking courses in Heinz College and Tepper School of Business (MBA and 
Computational Finance programs) must review and follow separate academic calendars; 
Similarly, students taking doctoral courses must review and follow the doctoral calendar for those courses. 
1Students dropping a course while remaining enrolled (in at least one course-section) will 
receive a tuition adjustment only if they drop by this date. Students taking a Leave of Absence 
or Withdrawing from the university should consult the official Tuition Adjustment Policy.
2Not applicable for graduate students in CFA, DC & SCS. Only graduate students in CIT, HC, 
MCS & TSB students receive W grades for course withdrawal.
3Course withdrawal is not an option after this date for students taking undergraduate or 
masters course-sections. Students must decide if they wish to use their course drop voucher, and should discuss their options with their academic advisor in advance of these dates. -- Students taking course-sections designated as doctoral courses are exempt from this restriction ONLY IN THOSE designated course-sections.
4Advisor approval is required for vouchers to be initiated. It is strongly recommended that you 
contact your advisor prior to the posted deadline to discuss options.
 -- Please contact your advisor before 12 noon on the deadline date.
 -- Doctoral students do not receive vouchers.
**Regarding Grade Due dates, please note that fall & spring mid-semester as well as mini-1 & 3 
grades are due the Monday after break instead of during break in both fall and spring. This 
confirms to a  desire for a single due date, and with mini finals on Saturday, it provides 
additional time for grading.
***Summer Session All corresponds to Summer Semester Dates. Summer Session One and 
Summer Session Two correspond to Summer One & Mini-5and Summer Two & Mini-6 dates 
& deadlines, respectively.
****Summer Session All, One and Two Final Exams will be scheduled by the University Registrar's Office.
