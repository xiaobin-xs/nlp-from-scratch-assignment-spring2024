The authors validate these lower and upper bounds using labeled data from two modalities: vision and language. They then apply them towards estimating multimodal performance without labeled multimodal data, serving as a strong signal for deciding whether to collect paired and labeled data from a second modality or whether existing fusion methods may already be quite optimal."

ML-SUPERB covers a wide range of languages, including both high-resource languages like English and endangered languages such as Totonac. The benchmark primarily focuses on evaluating SSL models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language identification (LID). To accommodate different use cases for SSL models, ML-SUPERB includes two tracks with four different tasks: the monolingual track (monolingual ASR), and the multilingual track (multilingual representation benchmarks, including ASR, speech translation, speech classification, and speech retrieval [15]. There are three main differences between XTREME-S and ML-SUPERB. Firstly, ML-SUPERB covers a wider range of languages, with 143 languages compared to XTREME-S’s 102. Secondly, ML-SUPERB focuses on ASR and LID, while XTREME-S covers four different tasks.

"We propose Block-wise Adaptive for Speech Sequences (BASS) as a solution that consumes input in blocks and passes semantic context across blocks, encouraging better learning. The BASS algorithm can be used to adapt pre-trained truncated input models to longer sequences or train models over long sequences from scratch."
"Previous studies on language acquisition have found that infants initially look at familiar objects when hearing semantically related labels for different objects, but adapt to more difficult tasks over time by learning more complex semantic representations of objects (Bergelson & Aslin, 2017a). Adults also learn new words from context and can use their ToM listener to infer the meaning of a word based on its relationship with other words in the same category. However, children are not able to do this until they have learned many more words (Bergelson & Aslin, 2017b)."
- The number of unique researchers publishing in ACL venues has increased dramatically, from 715 unique authors in 1980 to 17,829 in 2022.
"BASS-Adapt with block inference results in a nearly 4-point improvement in ROUGE-L over the truncated 10-second baseline, and a 1-point improvement in ROUGE-L over the truncated 30-second baseline."
