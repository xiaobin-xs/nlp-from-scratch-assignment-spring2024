Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with
self-supervision on vast corpora of web text
fit to the social biases of that text. Without
intervention, these social biases persist in the
model’s predictions in downstream tasks, lead-
ing to representational harm. Many strategies
have been proposed to mitigate the effects of
inappropriate social biases learned during pre-
training. Simultaneously, methods for model
compression have become increasingly pop-
ular to reduce the computational burden of
LLMs. Despite the popularity and need for
both approaches, little work has been done to
explore the interplay between these two. We
perform a carefully controlled study of the im-
pact of model compression via quantization and
knowledge distillation on measures of social
bias in LLMs. Longer pretraining and larger
models led to higher social bias, and quantiza-
tion showed a regularizer effect with its best
trade-off around 20% of the original pretraining
time.1
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on
large corpora using self-supervision, which allows
models to consider vast amounts of unlabelled
data, and learn language patterns through mask-
ing tasks (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019).
However, self-supervision allows LLMs to pick
up social biases contained in the training data.
Which is amplified by larger models, more data,
and longer training (Kaneko et al., 2022; Kaneko
and Bollegala, 2022; Kurita et al., 2019; Delobelle
and Berendt, 2022).
Social biases in LLMs are an ongoing prob-
lem that is propagated from pretraining to finetun-
ing (Ladhak et al., 2023; Gira et al., 2022). Biased
pretrained models are hard to fix, as retraining is
1https://github.com/gsgoncalves/
EMNLP2023_llm_compression_and_social_
biasprohibitively expensive both financially and envi-
ronmentally (Hessenthaler et al., 2022). At the
same time, the compression of LLMs has been
intensely studied. Pruning, quantization, and dis-
tillation are among the most common strategies to
compress LLMs. Pruning reduces the parameters
of a trained model by removing redundant con-
nections while preserving equivalent performance
to their original counterparts (Liebenwein et al.,
2021; Ahia et al., 2021). Quantization reduces
the precision of model weights and activations to
improve efficiency while preserving performance
(Ahmadian et al., 2023). Finally, knowledge distil-
lation (Hinton et al., 2015) trains a smaller more
efficient model based on a larger pre-trained model.
While much research has been done on mea-
suring and mitigating social bias in LLMs, and
making LLMs smaller and more efficient, by using
one or a combination of many compression meth-
ods (Xu et al., 2021), little research has been done
regarding the interplay between social biases and
LLM compression. Existing work has shown that
pruning disproportionately impacts classification
accuracy on low-frequency categories in computer
vision models (Hooker et al., 2021), but that prun-
ing transformer models can have a beneficial effect
with respect to bias when modeling multilingual
text (Hooker et al., 2020; Ogueji et al., 2022). Fur-
ther, Xu and Hu (2022) have shown that compress-
ing pretrained models improves model fairness by
working as a regularizer against toxicity.
Unlike previous work, our work focuses on the
impacts of widely used quantization and distilla-
tion on the social biases exhibited by a variety of
both encoder- and decoder-only LLMs. We fo-
cus on the effects of social bias over BERT (Devlin
et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and Pythia
LLMs (Biderman et al., 2023). We evaluate these
models against Bias Bench (Meade et al., 2022), a
compilation of three social bias datasets.
In our experimental results we demonstrate a cor-2663
relation between longer pretraining, larger models,
and increased social bias, and show that quantiza-
tion and distillation can reduce bias, demonstrating
the potential for compression as a pragmatic ap-
proach for reducing social bias in LLMs.
2 Methodology
We were interested in understanding how dynamic
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and distillation
influence social bias contained in LLMs of different
sizes, and along their pretraining. In dynamic PTQ,
full-precision floating point model weights are stat-
ically mapped to lower precisions after training,
with activations dynamically mapped from high
to low precision during inference. To this end, in
Section 2.1 we present the datasets of the Bias
Bench benchmark (Meade et al., 2022) that enable
us to evaluate three different language modeling
tasks across the three social bias categories. In
Section 2.2 we lay out the models we studied. We
expand on the Bias Bench original evaluation by
looking at the Large versions of the BERT and
RoBERTa models, and the Pythia family of au-
toregressive models. The chosen models cover
different language modeling tasks and span across
a wide range of parameter sizes, thus providing
a comprehensive view of the variations of social
bias.
2.1 Measuring Bias
We use the Bias Bench benchmark for evaluating
markers of social bias in LLMs. Bias Bench com-
piles three datasets, CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al.,
2020), StereoSet (SS) (Nadeem et al., 2021), and
SEAT (Kaneko and Bollegala, 2021), for measur-
ing intrinsic bias across three different identity cate-
gories: GENDER ,RACE , and RELIGION . While the
set of identities covered by this dataset is far from
complete, it serves as a useful indicator as these
models are encoding common social biases; how-
ever, the lack of bias indicated by this benchmark
does not imply an overall lack of inappropriate bias
in the model, for example with respect to other
groups. We briefly describe each dataset below;
refer to the original works for more detail.
CrowS-Pairs is composed of pairs of minimally
distant sentences that have been crowdsourced. A
minimally distant sentence is defined as a small
number of token swaps in a sentence, that carry
different social bias interpretations. An unbiasedmodel will pick an equal ratio of both stereotypi-
cal and anti-stereotypical choices, thus an optimal
score for this dataset is a ratio of 50%.
StereoSet is composed of crowdsourced samples.
Each sample is composed of a masked context
sentence, and a set of three candidate answers:
1) stereotypical, 2) anti-stereotypical, and 3) un-
related. Under the SS formulation, an unbiased
model would give a balanced number of classifica-
tions of types 1) and 2), thus the optimal score is
also 50%. The SS dataset also measures if we are
changing the language modeling properties of our
model. That is, if our model picks a high percent-
age of unrelated choices 3) it can be interpreted as
losing its language capabilities. This is defined as
the Language Model (LM) Score.
SEAT evaluates biases in sentences. A SEAT
task is defined by two sets of attribute sentences,
and two other sets of target sentences. The objec-
tive of the task is to measure the distance of the
sentence embeddings between the attribute and tar-
get sets to assess a preference between attributes
and targets (bias). We provide more detail of this
formulation in Appendix A.1.
2.2 Models
In this work, we focus on two popular methods
for model compression: knowledge distillation and
quantization. We choose these two methods given
their competitive performance, wide deployment
given the availability of distributions under the Hug-
gingFace and Pytorch libraries, and the lack of
understanding of the impact of these methods on
social biases. We leave the study of more elaborate
methods for improving model efficiency such as
pruning (Chen et al., 2020), mixtures of experts
(Kudugunta et al., 2021), and adaptive computation
(Elbayad et al., 2020) to future work.
Since model compression affects model size, we
are particularly interested in understanding how
pretrained model size impacts measures of social
bias, and how that changes as a function of how
well the model fits the data. We are also inter-
ested in investigating how the number of tokens
observed during training impacts all of the above.
We experiment with three different base LLMs:
BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al.,
2019), and Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023), with
uncompressed model sizes ranging from 70M pa-
rameters to 6.9B parameters. BERT and RoBERTa2664

represent two similar sets of widely used and stud-
ied pretrained architectures, trained on different
data with a small overlap. RoBERTa pretraining
was done over 161 GB of text, which contained the
16GB used to train BERT, approximately a ten-fold
increase. RoBERTa also trained for longer, with
larger batch sizes which have shown to decrease
the perplexity of the LLM (Liu et al., 2019).
The set of checkpoints released for the Pythia
model family allows us to assess an even wider
variety of model sizes and number of training to-
kens, including intermediate checkpoints saved dur-
ing pretraining, so that we can observe how bias
varies throughout pretraining. We used the mod-
els pretrained on the deduplicated version of The
Pile (Gao et al., 2021) containing 768GB of text.
Knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) is a
popular technique for compressing the knowledge
encoded in a larger teacher model into a smaller
student model. In this work, we analyze Distil-
BERT (Sanh et al., 2019) and DistilRoBERTa2
distilled LMs. During training the student model
minimizes the loss according to the predictions of
2https://huggingface.co/distilroberta-basethe teacher model (soft-targets) and the true labels
(hard-targets) to better generalize to unseen data.
Quantization compresses models by reducing
the precision of their weights and activations during
inference. We use the standard PyTorch implemen-
tation3to apply dynamic PTQ over the linear layers
of the transformer stack, from fp32 full-precision
to quantized int8 precision. This work analyzes
quantized BERT, RoBERTa, and Pythia models of
a comprehensive range of sizes.
3 Results
Dynamic PTQ and distillation lower social bias.
In Table 1 we analyze the effects of dynamic PTQ
and distillation in the CrowS dataset, where BERT
Base and RoBERTa Base are our baselines. To
compare quantization and distillation, we add three
debiasing baselines also referenced by Meade et al.
(2022) that are competitive strategies to reduce bias.
The INLP (Ravfogel et al., 2020) baseline consists
of a linear classifier that learns to predict the target
bias group given a set of context words, such as

’he/she’ . The Self-Debias baseline was proposed by
Schick et al. (2021), and uses prompts to encourage
models to generate toxic text and learns to give less
weight to the generate toxic tokens. Self-Debias
does not change the model’s internal representation,
thus it cannot be evaluated on the SEAT dataset.
Notable trends in Table 1 are the reduction of
social biases when applying dynamic PTQ and dis-
tillation, which can compete on average with the
specifically designed debias methods. Additional
results in in Appendix B also display similar trends.
On the SS dataset in Table 4 we are also able to
observe that the application of distillation provides
remarkable decreases in social biases, at the great
expense of LM score. However, dynamic PTQ
shows a better trade-off in providing social bias
reductions, while preserving LM score.
One model size does not fit all social biases. In
Table 1 and the equivalent Tables in Appendix B
we can see that social bias categories respond dif-
ferently to model size, across the different datasets.
While BERT Base/Large outperforms RoBERTa in
GENDER , the best model for RACE and RELIGION
varies across datasets. This can be explained by the
different dataset tasks and the pretraining.
In Appendix B we show the social bias scores asa function of the pretraining of the Pythia models in
Figures 2 to 7, 9, 10 and 11. The BERT/RoBERTa
Base and Large versions are roughly comparable
with the 160M and 410M Pythia models. For the
SS dataset, the 160M model is consistently less
biased than the 410M model. However, this is
not the case for the other two datasets where the
160M struggles in the RACE category while assess-
ing the distance of sentence embeddings (SEAT);
and in the RELIGION category while swapping min-
imally distant pairs (CrowS). This illustrates the
difficulty of distinguishing between semantically
close words, and shows the need for larger models
pretrained for longer and on more data.
Longer pretraining and larger models lead to
more socially biased models. We study the ef-
fects of longer pretraining and larger models on
social bias, by establishing the correlation of these
variables in Figure 1. Here we can observe that
as the model size increases so does the LM model
score and social bias across the SS dataset. More-
over, later stages of pretraining have a higher LM
model score, where the social bias score tends to
be high. The application of dynamic PTQ shows
a regularizer effect on all models.The Kendall Tau
C across the models and categories shows a strong2666
correlation between LM score and social bias. Sta-
tistical significant tests were performed using a
one-sided t-test to evaluate the positive correlation.
Tables 2 and 3 show at what step, out of the
21 we tested, the best LM scores occur on the SS
dataset. In Table 2 the best LM score increases
monotonically with model size and so do the social
biases. Interestingly, as the model size increases
the best LM score appears after around 80% of
the pretraining. In opposition, in Table 3, with
dynamic PTQ the best LM score occurs around
20% of the pretraining and maintains the trend of
higher LM score and social bias, albeit at lower
scores than the original models. This shows an
interesting possibility of early stopping depending
on the deployment task of the LLM.
4 Limitations
While this work provides three different datasets,
which have different views on social bias and allow
for an indicative view of LLMs, they share some
limitations that should be considered. The datasets
SS and CrowS define an unbiased model as one
that makes an equal amount of stereotypical and
anti-stereotypical choices. While we agree that this
makes a good definition of an impartial model it is
a limited definition of an unbiased model. This has
also been noted by Blodgett et al. (2021), showing
that CrowS is slightly more robust than SS by tak-
ing "extra steps to control for varying base rates be-
tween groups." (Blodgett et al., 2021). We should
consider that these datasets depict mostly Western
biases, and the dataset construction since it is based
on assessors it is dependent on the assessor’s views.
Moreover, Blodgett et al. (2021) has also noted
the existence of unbalanced stereotype pairs in SS
and CrowS, and the fact that some samples in the
dataset are not consensual stereotypes.
All datasets only explore three groups of biases:
GENDER ,RACE , and RELIGION , which are not by
any means exhaustive representations of social bias.
The experiments in this paper should be considered
indicative of social bias and need to be further stud-
ied. Additionally, the GENDER category is defined
as binary, which we acknowledge that does not
reflect the timely social needs of LLMs, but can
be extended to include non-binary examples by
improving on existing datasets.
We benefited from access to a cluster with two
AMD EPYC 7 662 64-Core Processors, where
the quantized experiments ran for approximately 4days. A CPU implementation was used given the
quantization backends available in PyTorch. Exper-
iments that did not require quantization ran using
an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU and took approxi-
mately 5 hours to run.
Ethics Statement
We reiterate that this work provides a limited West-
ern view of Social bias focusing only on three main
categories: GENDER ,RACE , and RELIGION . Our
work is further limited to a binary definition of
GENDER , which we acknowledge that does not re-
flect the current society’s needs. Moreover, we
must also reiterate that these models need to be fur-
ther studied and are not ready for production. The
effects of quantization along pretraining should be
considered as preliminary results.

A Details of Metric Calculation
A.1 SEAT
The SEAT task shares the same task as WEAT task,
which is defined by four word sets, two attribute
sets, and two target sets. For example, to decide
the presence of gender bias the two attribute sets
are disjoint sets given by: 1) a masculine set of
words, such as {’man’, ’boy’, ’he’, ... }, and 2) a
set of feminine words {’woman’, ’girl’, ’her’, ... }.
The target sets will characterize concepts such as
’sports’ and ’culinary’.
WEAT evaluates how close are the attribute sets
from the target sets to determine the existence of
bias. Mathematically this is given by:
s(A, B, X, Y ) =∑
x∈Xs(x, A, B )−∑
y∈Ys(y, A, B )
(1)Where AandBrepresent the attribute sets, and
XandYare the target sets of words. The sfunc-
tion in Equation (1) denotes mean cosine similarity
between the target word embeddings and the at-
tribute word embeddings:
s(w, A, B )=1
|A|∑
a∈Acos(w, a)−1
|B|∑
b∈Bcos(w, b).
(2)
The reported score of the benchmark (effect size)
is given by:
d=µ({s(x, A, B )}x∈X)−µ({s(y, A, B )}y∈Y)
σ({s(t, X, Y )}t∈A∪B)
(3)
Where µandσare the mean and standard de-
viation respectively. Equation (3) is designed so
that scores closer to zero indicate the smallest pos-
sible degree of bias. SEAT extends the previous
formulation by considering the distance sentence
embeddings instead of word embeddings.

Table 4: SS stereotype scores and language modeling scores (LM Score) for BERT, and RoBERTa models.
Stereotype scores closer to 50% indicate less biased model behavior. Bold values indicate the best method per
bias and LM Score. Results are on the SS test set. A random model (which chooses the stereotypical candidate
and the anti-stereotypical candidate for each example with equal probability) obtains a stereotype score of 50% in
expectation.
