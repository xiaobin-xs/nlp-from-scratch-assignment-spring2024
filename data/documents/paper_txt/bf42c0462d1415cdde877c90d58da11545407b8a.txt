1 Introduction
As part of the ongoing wav2gloss project, we are
generating Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) from
speech using an end-to-end system. In produc-
ing IGT for various languages of the Americas,
weencounteredachallenge: traditionalinterlinear
glossingschemesarewell-suitedfortherepresen-
tationofconcatenativemorphology( Comrieetal. ,
2008) where morphological properties are real-
izedbyspansofphonologicalmaterial( Goodman
etal.,2015;MaedaandBird ,2000;BirdandLiber-
man,1999;Bird et al.,2000;Ide and Suderman ,
2007). However, the languages that we are work-
ingwith—Mixtec,Nahuatl,andTotonac—areper-
meatedbymorphologicaloperationssuchastrun-
∗Denotesequalcontribution.cation,tonaloverwriting,reduplication,apophony,
and segmental overwriting, that cannot be ade-
quatelyexpressedastheconcatenation(orevenin-
terleaving) of strings. The shortcoming of most
IGTnotationsisthattheyrepresentthealignment
of affixes with glosses, but they do not explicitly
show how non-concatenative processes align to
glosses.
The contrast between concatenative and non-
concatenative “models of grammatical descrip-
tion” goes back at least to a seminal article by
CharlesHockett( 1954)inwhichheobservedthat
morphologycanbeviewedastheconcatenationof
morphemes(item-and-arrangementorIA)orasthe
applicationofprocessestomorphemes(item-and-
process or IP). Whatever their ontological nature
may be, some morphological operations—for ex-
ample,apophonyandtruncation—aremoreeasily
expressedas processes thanmorphemes. Inorder
toglosstheseoperations(andgivethemthesame
status as affixation), we needed to develop an an-
notationschememoregeneralthanthosecurrently
available. Therefore, we propose Generalized
GlossingGuidelines(orGGG),thatbuilduponex-
isting conventions such as the Leipzig Glossing
Rules (Comrie et al. ,2008) but make the frame-
workformallyexplicitandaddconsistentandcom-
prehensivesupportfornon-concatenativemorpho-
logical alternations such as infixation, reduplica-
tion, transfixation, apophony, tonal overwriting,
andtruncation.

2 Background
Alargenumberofglossingconventions,fromthe
very formal (e.g., Xigt; Goodman et al. 2015) to
the relatively informal (e.g., the Leipzig Glossing
RulesorLGR; Comrieetal. 2008)havebeenpro-
posedandemployedincomputationalapplications.
Forexample,arecentSIGMORPHONsharedtask
onglossingusedrepresentationsbasedonLGR.1
These conventions play two roles: (1) They al-
low linguists and language workers to communi-
catewithoneanotherwithclarityandminimalam-
biguity; (2)Theyallowhumansandcomputersto
communicatewithoneanotherwithrespecttothe
morphosyntax of human languages. In our use-
case, they allow neural models to communicate
thedetailsoftheirmorphosyntacticanalysestolan-
guageworkers. Assuch,theseannotationconven-
tionsneedtobebothhumanreadable(whetherdi-
rectlyorthroughsomekindofuserinterface)and
expressive,withoutsacrificingexplicitness.
Although LGR largely satisfies these critera
whenonlyconcatenativemorphologyoccurs,non-
concatenative operations are only supported in a
limited and sometimes inexplicit way in this con-
vention. The following example shows the LGR
notationforapophony(umlaut)inGerman:
(1)Ich
1.SGhabe
have. 1.SGvier
fourBrüder
brother\PL
‘Ihavefourbrothers.’
Thesequence“\PL”indicatesthatpluralismarked
by a non-concatenative process (in this case,
apophony),butitdoesnotindexthemorphological
property to a specific formal change. In the Gen-
eralized Glossing Guidelines described here, the
sameexamplewouldbethefollowing:2
(2)Ich
1.SGhabe
have. 1.SGvier
fourBr{u>ü}der
brother{PL}
‘Ihavefourbrothers.’
LGR also has conventions for annotating redupli-
cationandinfixation,buteachofthesenotationsis
different. ComparetheseexamplesfromMotu:

InLGR(3a),reduplicantsaredelimitedwithatilde.
In the GGG version ( 3b), again showing only lx,

tionasallothernon-concatenativeprocesses.

b.s{>um}ulat

In LGR (4a), infixes are surrounded by angle
brackets. IntheGGGversion( 4b),infixesareindi-
cated with the same notation as reduplication and
all other processes. Maximal empirical coverage
isachievedwithminimalformalequipment.
Another important framework for representing
IGT(andmorphosyntacticannotations,generally)
isXigt(Goodmanetal. ,2015),anXML-basedfor-
matthatassociatesannotationswithspans. It,too,
ishighlygeneral,machine-readable,andformally
rigorous,butitsopaquestructuremakesitdifficult
toreadandwritewithoutspecialsoftwaretools.
We propose GGG to take the best of the both
frameworks. Ithasthefollowingproperties:
•Generalandadaptable
•Humanreadable
•Machinereadableandunambiguous
•Editablewithgeneral-purposetools
•Consistentandformally-rigorousinitsrepre-
sentationofnon-concatenativeprocesses
2.1 Lexical Representations
The core of the GGG format is the lexical or lx
representation. Tounderstand lx,onemustdistin-
guishmorphologicalprocessesfromphonological
processesandimagineapipelineinwhichmorpho-
logicalprocessesprecedephonologicalprocesses.
Morphological processes are associated with
meaning or grammatical features. For example,
theMixtectonechangesshowninFigure 1mark
the habitual aspect. Phonological processes, in
contrast, are not associated with meanings. They
areprocessesthatapplywhenphonologicalcondi-
tions are met. For example, tone sandhi in many
languagesispurelyphonological(doesnotrealize
anymorphosyntacticproperties).59
InItem-and-ProcessMorphology,therearetwo
kindsofconstructsassociatedwithmeaning: mor-
phemes (items) and processes. The pipeline as-
sumed by GGG is one in which morphemes are
first assembled via concatenation (a MORPHEMIC
REPRESENTATION ). At this level, each instance of
the same morpheme has the same form (except
in cases of suppletion). Then, processes apply to
these strings. Together, the items and processes
formthelexicalrepresentation( lx)inGGG.This
representationistheoutputofthemorphologyand
theinputtothephonology.3
Phonological rules may apply to the lxrepre-
sentation, yielding phonologically conditioned al-
lomorphy. Some cases of nasalization shown in
thesrfield in Figure 1are phonological. Since
nasalizationisnotassociatedwithanymeaning,it
doesnotcorrespondtolabelsinthegloss( gl).
InGGG,the lxrepresentstheapplicationofpro-
cesses to morphemes—mapping between a MOR-
PHEMIC REPRESENTATION and an UNDERLYING REP-
RESENTATION . The bracket-and-arrow notation
shown in ( 3b) and (4b) above describes rewrites
between the morphemic form and the underlying
form. Thatistosay,themorphemicrepresentation
is everything outside of the brackets interspersed
with everything to the left of the arrows (>) and
theunderlyingrepresentationiseverythingoutside
ofthebracketsinterspersedwitheverythingtothe
rightofthearrows. Thesurfacerepresentation,in
contrast,istheoutputofthephonology.
2.2 GGG is purely descriptive
ThegoalofGGGis nottoprovideadeeptheoreti-
calaccountofmorphologybutrathertobepurely
descriptive. Thus—for example—even when we
believe that a morphological process is best ex-
plained by autosegmental tones being “bumped”
fromonemoratothefollowingmora,GGGrepre-
sentsthisprocessasthedeletionofatonefromone
mora of the morphemic representation and the si-
multaneousinsertionofanidenticaltoneonthefol-
lowingmoraintheunderlyingrepresentation(with
somelossofgenerality). Thisisdonetoexplicitly
statetheformalrelationshipbetweenamorphemic
form and underlying form while making a mini-
3Note that this approach assumes a non-trivial and con-
troversialassumptionaboutthephonology-morphologyinter-
face. It excludes interleaving between morphological and
phonologicalalternations. Thisisdonetomaketheglossing
formattractableandischaracteristicofglossingformatsgen-
erally. However,whencyclicphonologyresultsinatwo-step
change,GGGallowsthistoberepresented.mumoftheory-internalassumptions. Forexample,
in Yoloxóchitl Mixtec, the habitual is formed by
overwritinga/4/(high)tonetothefirstmora. Two
examplesaregivenin( 5):
(5)a.chio’{1>4}o{>1}4
cook_boiling{HAB;1,2}
habituallycookbyboiling’
b.sa{3>4}ta{>3}4
sa{3>4}ta{>2}4
buy{HAB;1,2}
‘habituallybuy’
Note that these changes are morphologically
(not phonologically) conditioned. In ( 5a), GGG
represents the tonal morphology as /1/ being re-
placed by /4/ and (the second) /4/ being preceded
by an inserted /1/, focusing on the superficial (in-
sertion of /1/ in the second mora) rather than the
deeprelationship(reassingmentofthesame/1/to
the second mora) between the morphemic repre-
sentationandtheunderlyingrepresentation(thein-
puttothephonologicalrules).
3 The Guidelines
GGG attempts to represent IGT examples like
those in the preceding section in a YAML format,
4preservingtothedegreepossibletheconventions
that are present when linguists typeset linguistic
data for the consumption of other linguists. This
alliesitwiththeSILShoeboxformatanddifferen-
tiatesitfromXigt( Goodmanetal. ,2015)andother
highlyexplicitIGTformats. Thisalsomakesitrel-
atively easy to edit GGG text using off-the-shelf
tools(e.g.,texteditorsandtranscriptiontools).
3.1 General Data Structure
An illustration of a YAML file for GGG is pre-
sented in Figure 1. The top level object is a map,
consisting of metadata fields ( obj_langfor “ob-
jectlanguage”and meta_lang for“metalanguage”
arerequired), and segs, whichisanarrayof“dis-
course segments” (roughly, sentences). The field
obj_langconsistsofasingleISO639-3code(asa

3codes. Eachdiscoursesegmentisamapwiththe

5In a few cases, this has proven problematic and has re-
sulted in redundancy, but in the general case, it has worked
well.61
Form tokens may contain annotations for MOR-
PHOLOGICAL PROCESSES suchasthefollowing:
•Reduplication
•Infixation
•Transfixation
•Apophony
•Tonaloverwriting
•Segmentaloverwriting
Theseareindicatedwithbracketedexpressions. In
lexicalforms( lx),theseconsistof {A>B}where A
andBcanbeanystringincludingtheemptystring.
These indicate a process in which Ahas been re-
placed by B. Examples include English t{u>i}θ
‘tooth{PL}.’ In srs, these consist of {A}, where
Acan be any string (including the empty string).
Theseindicatesubstringsthataretheresultofthe
application of a process. Take, for example, En-
glish t{i}θ‘tooth{PL}‘. Foracompleteexample,
see Figure 1. In some cases, there may be a hi-
erarchical relationship between processes, where
one process “feeds” another. This is indicated by
providing additional steps using the bracket-and-
arrow notation, e.g., {3>1>4}as in the following
examples from Yoloxóchitl Mixtec. In ( 6a) and

both DTR and HAB are represented by {3>1>4}.
The low tone /1/ is then reassigned to the second
mora (shown in GGG as the “insertion” of /1/ on
/i/). Inmanycasesthis“push”offirstmora’sorigi-
nal tone (/1/ or /3/) onto the second mora occurs,
forming a contour tones (e.g., /14/ and underly-
ing/34/(surface/24/byphonologicalruleafterthe

Phonology
The process notations are not meant to represent
purelyphonologicalalternations. Ifanalternationcanbeaccountedforbyarulethatiswhollycondi-
tioned by the surrounding phonological segments
orsyllablestructureandprosodiccontext,itshould
be treated as phonological and not directly repre-
sentedinthe lxfield. The lxfieldshouldcontain

Table2: Exampleformsandglossesforarangeofmor-
phologicalprocesses.
Conventions for associating gloss tokens with
morpheme tokens (see Table 2) are based on the
Leipzig glossing conventions with significant ex-
tensions. When possible, labels for categories
are derived from the Unimorph schema ( Sylak-
Glassman,2016).
Each gloss token consists of a lexical or mor-
pheme gloss followed by a sequence of process
glosses(eachenclosedincurlybrackets)andzero
or one delimiters { =,-} which may be either pre-
posed or postposed. Process glosses consist of
lexical glosses or morpheme glosses and an op-
tionalsemicolonfollowedbyalistofnumberssep-
arated by commas. The numbers indicate the in-
dexofspans(startingfrom1)inthecorresponding
formtheglossappliesto. Forexample, inArabic
k{i>u}t{aː>u}b ‘book{PL;1,2}’,thePLproperty
is realized by two changes ({>u} and {>u}) and
thisisindicatedbythespanindices(1,2)afterthe
semicolon. Foreaseofannotation,ifthereisonly
oneprocessinaword,theindexcanbeomitted.
Some form tokens have more than one as-
sociated process. The corresponding glosses
are provided in successive bracketed expres-
sions after that lexical or morpheme gloss.
For example, in Arabic k{>a}t{>ː}{>a}b{>a}62
‘write{PST;1,3}{CAUS;2}{3.SG.M;4}’,thereare
three processes, indicated by the three properties
in brackets with their respective indices. The use
of indices means the alignment between brack-
etedexpressionsinformsandglossesisdetermin-
istic. The orders of the processes (bracketed ex-
pressions) in the gloss can be arbitrary, but—as a
group—they should appear only at the end of the
gloss.
Morpheme glosses are drawn from the Uni-
morphSchema( Sylak-Glassman ,2016)whenpos-
sible.6Whenglossesforderivationalmorphology
are present in the Leipzig Rules but not in Uni-
morph, the Leipzig gloss should be used. When
a needed category is not represented in either re-
source,itwillbeaddedtothestandard.
Super-categoriesoffeaturesarerepresentatedas
CATEGORY:: . Thus, first-person plural subject is
representedas SUBJ::1.PL .
3.6 Disjunctions
Disjunctions between properties can indicated
with the pipe ( |) operator and grouping can
be indicated with square brackets. The |op-
erator binds more closely than the .opera-
tor. Thus, English youmay be glossed (out
of context) as 2.SG|PL.NOM|ACC (second person,
singular or plural and nominative or accusative.
Square brackets can be used for grouping. Ger-
man siecan be glossed (out of context) as
3.[SG.FEM]|[PL.NOM|ACC] (third person, either
feminine singular or unspecified for gender and
plural and either nominative or accusative). Dis-
junctionsaretobeusedwhentheexactanalysisof
a wordform, in context, is not clear to an annota-
tor. In general, their use should be minimized as
thequalityoftheannotationsimproves.
3.7 Translations
Eachdiscoursesegmentshouldbeaccompaniedby
anidiomatictranslationintothemetalanguage.
3.8 Parsing GGG
Parsing GGG is more complicated than parsing
XigtbecauseGGGis,effectively,an 𝐴𝑛𝐵𝑛𝐶𝑛lan-
guage. TovalidateorparseGGG,onemustensure
that three sequences, lx,sr, and gl, are the same
length (when split into tokens on white space).
This means that context-free parsing for GGG is
not possible. This adds some overhead to writing
6See,also https://unimorph.github.io/schema/toolsforGGG.However,wehavewrittenparsing,
generation, and validation tools for GGG without
excessiveinvestments.7
4 Linguistic Adequacy
The adequacy of GGG for annotating concatena-
tivemorphologyisidenticaltothatofLGR,since
the mechanism is borrowed from LGR directly.
Theonlymodificationisthatmorphemeswithina
wordaredividedbyspacesinadditiontohyphens
andequalsigns. Thismeansthattheheadednessof
compounds must be stated explicitly (with depen-
dentstreatedlikeaffixes).
TheGGGapproach,however,hasadistinctad-
vantageinthetreatmentofnon-concatenativemor-
phology,asitisabletoachievecompleteadequacy
(thoughnottheoreticalcorrectnessordepthofgen-
eralization)throughtheuseofasingleannotation
mechanism: {A?>B?(;C)?}. We show that the
convention works well for infixation, reduplica-
tion,truncation,apophony,tonaloverwriting,seg-
mental overwriting, transfixation, and other simi-
larprocesses.
4.1 Infixation
Infixation involves the inserting of a morpheme
into a morpheme. Take the following examples
fromUlwa,aMisumalpanlanguageofNicaragua.
Possessives are denoted by affixes such as “ka”
(3.SG)and“ki”(1.SG),whichmayoccuraseither
suffixesorinfixesdependingonthesyllablestruc-
ture of the word. Therefore, in all of these cases,
we are treating the affixes as morphological pro-
cesses.McCarthyandPrince (1993)

4.2 Reduplication
Reduplication refers to the realization of a mor-
phological property by repeating material from a
base. InthisexamplefromMangap-Mbula,aVC-
sequence is reduplicated after the base, to mark
progressiveaspect: ( Bugenhagen ,1995)
-
lx:”kuk{>uk}”
sr:”kuk{uk}”gl:”bark{PROG}”
tr:”be barking”
GGG can deal with relatively complex types of
redupulication such as occur in Balsas Nahuatl8,
in which the repeated material can ultimately be
realizedasahightoneand/oralengthenedvowel
(whicharenotnecessarilycontiguous):
-
lx:”ti- ne:{>◌ ́}ch- {>te}te:mowa -0”
sr:”ti- ne:{◌ ́}x- {te}te:mowa -0”
gl:”SUBJ::2SG- OBJ::1SG- \
{RED_H;1,2}look\_for -PRS.IND.SG”
tr:”You look for me.”
-
lx:”ni- mi{>:◌ ́}ts- te:mowa -0”
sr:”ni- mi{:◌ ́}s- te:mowa -0”
gl:”SUBJ::1SG- OBJ::2SG- \
8The acute accent indicates a high tone. Unlike other va-
rietiesofNahuatl,BalsasNahuatlistonal( GuionandAmith ,
2005;Guionetal. ,2010).64
{RED_H;1}look\_for -PRS.IND.SG”
tr:”Ilook for you.”
GGG is uniquely able to formalize Balsas Nahu-
atl reduplication with a fixed coda laryngeal
(RDP_H),areduplicantthatcanberealizedonthe
the stem in various ways (first, third, and fourth
examples) or on a prefix (second example). The
commonality of all four cases is established by
the common gloss: (RDP_H). Reduplication may
be prefixing, suffixing, or infixing. The case of
infixing reduplication is particularly problematic
for LGR, since it is not clear which convention—
thetildeconventionforreduplicationortheangle-
bracketnotationforinfixation—shouldtakeprece-
dence. In GGG, the notation is the same and this
decision is not necessary. Take the following ex-
amplefromPima( Riggle,2006):
-
lx:”ma{>m}vit ̪ ”
sr:”ma{m}vit ̪ ”
gl:”lion{PL}”
tr:”lions”
-
lx:”tʃɨ{>tʃ}mait ̪ ”
sr:”tʃɨ{tʃ}mait ̪ ”
gl:”drum{PL}”
tr:”drums”
A similar pattern of infixing reduplication can
befoundinLatin:
-
ur:”s{>po}pond{>ī}”
sr:”s{po}pond{ī}”
gl:”perform{1.SG.PRF.IND;1,2}
4.3 Subtractive morphology
Subtractivemorphologyinvolvesthedeletionofa
segmental material from a base. The Murle lan-
guageintheSurmicfamilysubtractsthelastconso-
nantofanountochangeitfromsingulartoplural:
(Arensen,1982)
lx:”nyoo{n>0}”
sr:”nyoo{}”
gl:”lamb{PL}”
tr:”lambs”
-
lx:”wawo{c>0}”
sr:”wawo{}”
gl:”white_heron{PL}”
tr:”white herons”There appears to be no standard way of notating
this in LGR. In Xigt, we believe that subtractive
morphology could be notated by aligning a gloss
withanemptystring,butthiswouldmakeitindis-
tinguishablefromrealizingamorphologicalprop-
ertyvianochangetotheform.
4.4 Apophony
Apophony refers to a process in which a morpho-
logical property is realized through an alternation
in phonemes. Take the following examples from
Irish,inwhichvowelalternationisusedtoturnsin-
gularnounsintoplural( FifeandKing ,2017).
-
lx:”c{ea>i}nn”
sr:”c{i}nn”
gl:”head{PL}”
tr:”heads”
-
lx:”m{ui>a}r{>a}”
sr:”m{a}r{a}”
gl:”sea{PL;1,2}”
tr:”seas”
Apophony in Totonac often involves consonants
changes,likechanging/ʃ/to/s/:
-
lx:”{ʃ>s}kú'ta'”
sr:”{s}kú'ta'”
gl:”sour{DIM}”
tr:”alittle sour”
-
lx:”{ʃ>s}uːni'”
sr:”{s}uːni'”
gl:”bitter{DIM}”
tr:”alittle bitter”
LGRallowsonetoindicatethatapophononyaf-
fectsamorpheme,butdoesnotapplyanotationfor
specifying its locus. Apparently Xigt has no way
todistinguishapophonyfrominfixation.
4.5 Tonal overwriting
Tonal overwriting refers to the class of morpho-
logical processes in which a tonal “affix” over-
writestheexistingtonalmelodyonabase. Exam-
ples from Yoloxóchitl Mixtec—which uses tonal
overwritingtoindicatedifferentverbalinflections,
suchashabitualandnegative—follow:
-
lx:”ta'{3>1>4}bi{>1}4”65
sr:”ta'{4}bi{14}”
gl:”get-broken{HAB;1,2}”
tr:”habitually get broken”
In Xigt, there is not a clear way of distinguishing
these changes from infixation. In LGR, these can
berepresentedwiththebackslashnotationusedfor
apophony,withthesamedrawbacks.
4.6 Segmental overwriting
Tonal overwriting is fairly common. The analo-
goussegmentalprocess—inwhichastringofseg-
ments is overwritten by other segments—is rela-
tivelyrare,butdoesexist. Thefollowingexample
fromYoloxóchitlMixtecemployssegmentalover-
writingtoinflectaclassofverbsasirrealis:
-
lx:”{xi>ku}3xi3”
sr:”{ku}3xi3”
gl:”eat{IRR}”
tr:”eat”
4.7 Transfixation
Transfixation involves interspersing affixal spans
into a root morpheme. In Semitic languages such
as Arabic and Hebrew, words are mostly associ-
ated with 3-consonant roots. In Arabic, k-t-bis a
root meaning “write” and d-r-sis a root meaning
“study”. Theserootsarecombinedwithpatternsof
vowelstoformwords.
Transfixation is particularly tricky to represent
using LGR, and it is unclear which convention
should be used to do so (the angle-bracket infix
notation or the backslash non-concatenative nota-
tion). InGGG,allofthepatternsinsertedintothe
rootaretreatedasmorphologicalprocesses,using
thebracketnotation.
Take the following examples from Arabic,
which show how different vowel patterns can dis-
tinguishbetweensingularandpluralnouns,aswell
asdifferentformsofverbs.
lx:”q{a>u}l{>uu}b”
sr:”q{u}l{uu}b”
gl:”heart{PL;1,2}”
tr:”hearts”
-
lx:”d{>a}r{>a}s{>a}”
sr:”d{a}r{a}s{a}”
gl:”study{PST;1,2}{3.SG.M;3}”
tr:”he studied”Transfixation can be combined with other pro-
cesses as well. For example, gemination on the
2nd consonant of the root is used to turn a Form
I verb into a causative Form II verb ( Haspelmath
andSims,2010).
-
lx:”d{>a}r{>ː}{>a}s{>a}”
sr:”d{a}r{ː}{a}s{a}”
gl:”study{PST;1,3}{CAUS;2}{3.SG.M;4}”
tr:”he taught”

5 Conclusions
As should be clear from Table 1, most of the at-
testedtypesofmorphologicalprocessescanberep-
resentedinallthreeannotationformats. However,
GGG has clear advantages in some areas. For ex-
ample,ifalinguistwantstoknowhownounswith
a particular singular form are realized in the plu-
ral, without knowing in advance what processes
areinvolved,theycoulddiscoverthisthroughrel-
atively simple processing of GGG—because it is
completely explicit. It would be immediately ev-
ident whether the process was a particular kind
ofapophony,reduplication,tonaloverwriting,etc.
For the other two annotation formats, this kind
of research—if non-concatenative processes are
involved—isconsiderablymorecomplicated.
One cost, because of its explicitness, is that
GGG annotation cannot be completed until a lin-
guist has a thorough (though fundamental) analy-
sisofalanguage’smorphology. Ourgoalistode-
velop tools to facilitate this analysis: to go from
basicrecordingstointerlinearannotationswithre-
ducedhumanintervention. WehopethatGGGwill
beanimportantpartofthisongoingwork. Butthe
benefits are great. We are currently using GGG
with great success in our ongoing research and
hope that other investigators will find it similarly
useful.
