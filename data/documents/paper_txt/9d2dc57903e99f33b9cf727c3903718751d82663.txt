ABSTRACT
Language Models (LMs) achieve substantial language capabilities when finetuned
using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF
is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality
LM-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL
(A-L OL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training
on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single
action, A-L OLallows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed
scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM’s internal sequence-level
value estimate, A-L OLfilters negative advantage (low-quality) data points during
training, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-L OLis an easy-to-implement LM
training recipe that is sample-efficient and stable.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-L OLand its variants with a set of four
different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO)
and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL
baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless As-
sistant (HHA), LMs trained with A-L OLmethods achieve the highest diversity
while also being rated more safe and helpful than baselines according to humans.
Additionally, in the remaining three tasks, A-L OLcould optimize multiple distinct
reward functions even when using noisy or suboptimal training data.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Pretrained (Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020) and/or instruction-tuned (Wei et al., 2022a; Chung
et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022b) large Language Models (LMs) show huge improvements in quality
and safety when finetuned with Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang
et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b). However, the most popular RLHF method, Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017), is sensitive to hyperparameters and suffers from training
instability (Yuan et al., 2023; Casper et al., 2023). More importantly, PPO periodically requires
new batches of LM-generated data for each training step which leads to additional computational
overhead and risk of distribution/mode collapse (Song et al., 2023b; Shumailov et al., 2023; Go et al.,
2023). Given these limitations, we ask: Can we perform rewarded learning, similar to PPO, while
only using pre-existing data?
We propose Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-L OL), a set of sample-efficient and stable learning
algorithms that uses Offline Policy Gradients (Degris et al., 2012; Weng, 2018) to optimize LMs
towards any desired rewards using only pre-collected language data. Notably in A-L OL, we assume
the entire output sequence as a single action step, which allows it to calculate training data advantage
and filter unfavorable instances. The advantage is the reference LM’s value estimate subtracted
from the reward, which determines the benefit of each training instance toward the learning process.
Subsequently, discarding the data points with negative advantages improves the learning efficiency of
A-L OL and makes it robust to noisy data.
A-L OLis very easy to implement over standard cross entropy loss using two key improvements: (1)
sequence-level advantage and (2) importance weight (used to discourage big divergence of target
LM’s distribution from the initial reference LM). As illustrated in Table 1, our method only requires
a sequence-level reward with single output for every data point, in contrast to recent preference-based

(Rafailov et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023a) offline RL methods that require human-labeled pairwise
comparisons. Importantly, A-L OLand its variants share most similarities with PPO, while greatly
simplifying the training and also enabling offline learning.
Through a series of four different language generation tasks, each using one or more classifiers to
calculate the reward, we show that A-L OLconsistently outperforms the baselines while using the
least amount of training data. We first experiment with the RLHF benchmark task, Helpful and
Harmless Assistant (HHA) (Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli et al., 2022) (§4), where both human-labeled
preference data and reward model are available. We systematically compare all offline RL algorithms
using the same 7B base model architecture and show training stability trends over multiple random
seeds. We find that A-L OLvariants achieve comparable average reward to DPO while offering more
stable learning, lower variance, and higher response diversity than every other baseline. In a more
qualitative evaluation, humans judge the A-L OL models to be the most helpful and safe. In another
single-reward experiment with the Commonsense Reasoning task (West et al., 2022) (Appendix
§C.1), A-L OL again showed the highest improvement in quality and diversity among the baselines.
We also demonstrate A-L OL’s flexibility to utilize multiple rewards in RL training, which contrasts
with preference-based methods that can only support unidimensional preferences. In particular,
we experiment with two multi-reward dialog tasks, Reddit response generation ( §5), and Faithful
knowledge-grounded dialog (Dinan et al., 2019) (Appendix §C.2). In both tasks, A-L OLwas able
to simultaneously optimize four or more different reward functions that improved fluency, safety,
diversity, and other qualitative attributes of the LMs, even in the presence of noisy training data. Our
findings demonstrate that A-L OLis a robust, stable, sample-efficient offline RL method for language
learning that can be easily substituted with cross-entropy loss in tasks where real-value rewards are
available. We release the code at https://github.com/abaheti95/LoL-RL .
2 A DVANTAGE -LEFTOVER LUNCH RL
Before introducing our main method, we first briefly explain how we frame language generation tasks
as an RL game with the single-action assumption ( §2.1). We then derive the main learning objective
ofA-L OLusing offline policy gradient ( §2.2). To better contextualize A-L OL, we also discuss its
relationship with log-likelihood loss, weighted Behavior Cloning (Wang et al., 2020) ( §2.3) and a
another offline policy gradient algorithm GOLD (Pang & He, 2021) (§2.4).2
1We do not compare with other online RL (Shi et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023; Peng et al.,
2023; Zhu et al., 2023) that are very similar to PPO and preference-based method (Zhao et al., 2023) similar to
DPO. We also avoid comparing with offline RL methods that require additional data manipulation (Lu et al.,
2022; Welleck et al., 2022; Jang et al., 2022; Verma et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2022; Cho et al., 2023; Liu et al.,
2023) and model architecture changes (Kim et al., 2022; Snell et al., 2023).
2We also discuss A-L OL’s connection with PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) in Appendix §A.

Figure 1: Illustration of Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL in practice. We first supervised finetune
the reference policy ( πref) on the training data as a precursor to A-L OLtraining. Then, an external
reward model is employed to train the value estimate layer ( Vπref) on frozen πref. Subsequently, using
the reference policy values on Dtr, we can find instances with positive advantage. A-L OLthen
multiplies the positive advantage and importance weight with negative log likelihood to train target
LM (πθ). Evaluation on Dtestshows LM trained with A-L OLachieves higher average reward and
better distribution compared to the reference policy.
2.1 L ANGUAGE TASKS AS RL WITH SINGLE ACTION EPISODES
We consider language generation as a sequence-to-sequence task containing training Dtrand valida-
tionDvsets with pairs of input xand output ysequences. Contrasting with previous RL methods
that consider each token in yas a separate action (Pang & He, 2021; Kim et al., 2022; Snell et al.,
2023; Ramamurthy et al., 2023), we consider the entire yas a single action from the LM agent,
after which the agent receives the task-specific sequence-level reward R(x,y, ⋆)and the episode
ends. The single-action assumption allows incorporating any pretrained attribute-specific classifiers
or human-designed scoring functions as a reward during offline finetuning. When multiple scoring
functions are available, we set the reward to the sum of all the functions.
2.2 O FFLINE POLICY GRADIENT TO ADVANTAGE LOL RL
To derive our main learning equation, we start with the Offline Policy Gradient objective (Degris
et al., 2012; Weng, 2018). Let πrefbe the reference policy LM trained on Dtrwith standard negative
likelihood loss (NLL) and πθbe the target policy we want to optimize, which is initially identical to
πref. Both πrefandπθtake the input sequence x(state) and generate an output sequence y(action).
Using the single action episode assumption, we can write the stationary distribution of reference
policy as dπref(x) =P(x|πref) =P(x), where xbelongs to the set of all input sequences X. We can
then optimize target policy πθon this stationary distribution dπrefwith the following objective:
J(θ) = max
θX
x∈Xdπref(x)X
y∈YR(x,y, ⋆)πθ(y|x) (1)
where Yis the set of all outputs. Taking a derivative of the above equation with respect to θyields:
∇θJ(θ) =∇θEx∼dπref[X
y∈YR(x,y, ⋆)πθ(y|x)] =Ex∼dπref[X
y∈YR(x,y, ⋆)∇θπθ(y|x)] (2)
We then multiply and divide by πθ(y|x)andπref(y|x)and further simplify the equation as follows,
∇θJ(θ) =Ex∼dπref,y∼πref[R(x,y, ⋆)|{z}
rewardπθ(y|x)
πref(y|x)|{z}
importance weight∇θlnπθ(y|x)|{z}
NLL] (3)
Here, the importance weight3is the ratio of sequence-level probability of ybetween πθandπref,
which results into a single scalar factor. Observe that the inputs of Dtrare a subset of the dπref, i.e.
all possible texts in the language generation task X. Also, the ground truth outputs in Dtrare the
outputs πrefis trained to imitate. Using these observations, we update the expectation in the previous
equation and obtain the Reward L OL RL objective (with a negative sign to show minimization):
∇θJR-L OL(θ) =−EDtr[R(x,y, ⋆)·r(θ,ref)· ∇θlnπθ(y|x)] (4)
3http://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2014/12/21/importance-sampling/

where r(θ,ref) =πθ(y|x)
πref(y|x)is the shorthand for importance weight .
For boosting learning efficiency, we can replace R(x,y, ⋆)in equation 4 with advantage , defined
asAπθ(x,y, R) =R(x,y, ⋆)−Vπθ(x), i.e., the policy’s estimate of expected reward for the input
subtracted from the actual reward of the training data (Schulman et al., 2016). However, maintaining
the most recent value estimate of πθis difficult, as it is constantly updated during training. Therefore,
we swap the reward in equation 4 with the advantage of the frozen reference policy, Aπref(x,y, R) =
R(x,y, ⋆)−Vπref(x). We call this the Advantage L OL RL objective.
∇θJA-L OL(θ) =−EDtr[Aπref(x,y, R)·r(θ,ref)· ∇θlnπθ(y|x)] (5)
To compute πref’s value estimate, we initialize a small network of multi-head attention (Vaswani
et al., 2017) and a single-layer MLP on top of frozen parameters of πref. This value estimate module
takes the last hidden layer representation of πref(x)and predicts expected future reward Vπref(x). We
cheaply train this value estimate on the rewards achieved by πrefon the validation set ( Dv) with mean
squared error loss. We then calculate the Aπref(x,y, R)for all instances in Dtr. Figure 1 illustrates an
example of how A-L OLimproves the distribution of test rewards by using the value estimate of the
reference policy. Next, we describe several other variants of A-L OL algorithm.
Variants with alternative Importance Weight Exploiting the flexibility offered by importance
weight in A-L OL, we experiment with three alternatives. First, we create A-L OL(ref. free) by
setting the importance weight to 1. In the second variant, we convert the full-sequence importance
weight in A-L OL(equation 5) to a per-token importance weight. Specifically, we propose an
approximate importance weight multiplied with log-likelihood using the probability chain rule as
follows,πθ(y|x)
πref(y|x)∇θlnπθ(y|x)≈P|y|
i=1[πθ(yi|x,y<i)
πref(yi|x,y<i)∇θlnπθ(yi|x, y<i)], where yiis the ithtoken in
yandy<iare the preceding tokens. We name this variant A-L OLsequence . Finally, inspired by
PPO’s ablations (Schulman et al., 2017), we experiment with replacing the importance weight with a
weighted KL penalty to obtain A-L OL KL :
∇θJA-L OL KL(θ) =−EDtr
Aπref(x,y, R)· ∇θlnπθ(y|x)−β· ∇θlnπθ(y|x)
lnπref(y|x)
(6)
We propose two more modifications in A-L OL training to improve its stability and efficiency.
Clipping Importance Weight Direct usage of A-L OLobjective (Equation 5) in training is unstable
as loss values can fluctuate hugely depending on the importance weight r(θ,ref). To mitigate this
issue, we clip the importance weight as clip(r(θ,ref),1−ϵ,1 +ϵ)(Schulman et al., 2017). This
clip operator discourages big changes from reference policy. In A-L OLsequence, we apply the clip
operator separately to the importance weight of every token in the output.
Reward/Advantage Priority Sampling In all the experiments, we find that a non-trivial amount
of data points in Dtrobtain a negative advantage ( Aπref<0). We discard these data points as they
may not help in generalizing beyond πref. To boost the training efficiency of A-L OLeven more,
we employ positive advantage-based weighted sampling of train instances (similar to Welleck et al.,
2022). We present the full pseudo code for A-L OLin Algorithm 1. For reward-based offline RL
methods, we similarly employ reward-based priority sampling in all the experiments.
Overall, A-L OLand its variants are efficient and easy to implement on top of standard negative
log-likelihood as it only involves multiplying two factors: advantage/reward, and importance weight.
Furthermore, the positive-advantage priority sampling makes A-L OL’s training very efficient, some-
times reaching close to peak generalization with only 30% additional steps (see Figure 2).
2.3 R ELATIONSHIP WITH NLL AND WEIGHTED BEHAVIOR CLONING
We draw connections between Reward LOL RL and other learning methods. If we set both
R(x,y, ⋆) = 1 andr(θ,ref) = 1 in the equation 4, it reduces to negative log-likelihood objec-
tive. This implies that maximum likelihood learning is a subset of R-L OL’s objective. By carefully
adjusting the R(x,y, ⋆)term while keeping r(θ,ref) = 1 , both data filtering (West et al., 2022) and
weighted behavior cloning4(Wang et al., 2020) can also be viewed as subsets of our method.
4Weighted behavior cloning simply multiplies the NLL objective with the reward R(x,y, ⋆).

2.4 C OMPARISON WITH GOLD
Previously, Pang & He (2021) developed the GOLD algorithm using a similar offline policy gradient
derivation, but without the single-action approximation. Compared to R-L OLobjective (equation
4), GOLD objective has two peculiar differences: (1) it approximates reference policy probability
as constant in the importance weight, and (2) it uses reference policy’s per-token log-probability
as token-level reward. Intuitively, this method “encourages the learning algorithm to focus on
easy examples (high likelihood under the model)” (Pang & He, 2021). However, it cannot trivially
include arbitrary sparse-reward like R-L OL. For comparison, we use the single-action assumption
and replace the per-token reward with a sequence-level reward to get the Reward GOLD objective,
−EDtr[R(x,y, ⋆)πθ(y|x)∇θlnπθ(y|x)], where we approximate the importance weight and NLL asP|y|
i=1max( πθ(yi|x, y<i), u)∇θlnπθ(yi|x, y<i)with lower bound ufor stability.
3 E XPERIMENTAL SETUP AND BASELINES
We conduct experiments with four different language generation tasks: two single-reward tasks
(Helpful and Harmless Assistant, Section §4 and Commonsense Reasoning, Appendix §C.1) and two
multiple-rewards tasks (Reddit response generation, Section §5 and Knowledge Grounded Dialog,
Appendix §C.2). In each experiment, we use a separate reference LM which is the starting point
for all learning methods and we continue further finetuning for a roughly equal number of steps
(depending on the Dtrsize). Overall, we compare A-L OLand its modified importance weight
variants ( A-L OL(ref. free) ,A-L OLseq., and A-L OLKL) against negative log-likelihood ( NLL )
and the following offline RL baselines:
Preference-based Baselines We experiment with three offline RL algorithms that directly use the
human-labeled preference data to solve the RLHF task. DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023) converts the
constrained reward optimization into a preference classification loss by defining a surrogate reward
as the ratio of target policy and reference policy log probabilities. Subsequent work introduced PRO
(Song et al., 2023a) that extends DPO’s classification loss into a ranking loss and interpolates it with
the negative log-likelihood for stability. For ablation purposes, we also test DPO (ref. free) , a variant
of DPO without the reference policy log probabilities. We cannot test with preference-based methods
in tasks with multiple rewards or where human-labeled preferences are not available.
Reward-based Baselines We also compare with R-L OL(Equation 4) and other related reward-
based offline RL methods: wBC (§2.3) and Reward GOLD (§2.4).
4 HHA: H ELPFUL AND HARMLESS ASSISTANT TASK
Our main experiment uses the Helpful and Harmless assistant dataset (Bai et al., 2022a; Ganguli
et al., 2022) containing 170K instances of user-assistant conversations that end with a pair of model-
generated responses. The final responses are labeled good andbadrespectively to indicate human
preference labels. The dataset comprises four subsets: Harmless basecontaining red-teaming conversa-
tions which attempt to illicit harmful responses, while the other three, Helpful base, Helpful online, and
Helpful rejection , contain advice and assistance seeking conversations. We reuse the data splits from

Song et al. (2023a) with minor data cleaning.5In total, this task has 143K train, 280 validation, and
8.2K test conversations and their human preference labeled responses.
Reference LM, Reward model and Training We choose LLaMA-7B base architecture (Touvron
et al., 2023a) with QLoRA adapter (Dettmers et al., 2023) pretrained on HHA dataset6as the reference
policy. We also test PPO7in this experiment, along with the aforementioned offline RL baselines and
A-L OL variants. In total, we executed 36 different training runs for 12 learning methods, each with
three random seeds. For all algorithms using rewards, we employ a 1.4B parameter classifier8trained
on human preference labels as the reward model.
While preference-based RL methods use all training paired comparisons, other methods only use the
good subset responses during training. In fact, A-L OL methods are most data efficient, by ignoring
≈33% ofgood responses that were identified as negative advantage. We roughly allocate one epoch
of training steps for every offline RL method, depending on their training data requirements. We train
PPO for 1.3×the training steps of offline methods (excluding the computation cost of generating
online data). Finally, as a benchmark, we also evaluate an external 6B model trained with PPO on the
HHA dataset.9We present the implementation details of all tested methods in Appendix B.1.
4.1 HHA R ESULTS
Stability Comparison of Offline RL algorithms Figure 2 shows the trajectories of validation
reward achieved by all offline RL methods averaged across three random seeds. The leftplot shows
that preference-based methods, especially DPO and DPO (ref. free), suffer from high variance
across random seeds when compared with NLL training. In contrast, the reward-based methods have
comparable or even lower variance than NLL ( middle ). In the right plot, we observe that A-L OL
methods also show similar stability as reward-based methods, while achieving higher rewards.
Among our advantage-based methods, A-L OL(ref. free) achieves lower validation performance
than other variants. A-L OLKL, on the other hand, can become unstable by minimizing the KL
penalty term instead of policy-gradient loss, as evidenced by a drop in performance towards the end
of training. Comparatively, A-L OL and A-L OL seq. steadily improve throughout the training.
We also separately plot the three trajectories of PPO in Appendix Figure 3 and notice one of the seeds
shows performance deterioration and mode-collapse (Shumailov et al., 2023; Go et al., 2023).
Automatic Evaluation and Analysis We employ a larger 6.5B parameter reward model10to
evaluate the best checkpoints from each run on the test set. We also compare the response distribution
using average length and diversity measures (Distinct-1, 2, and 3), which are calculated as the ratio of
unique unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams (Li et al., 2016). The average evaluation metrics obtained by
each method across three random seeds are reported in Table 2. In the first three rows, we establish
the test set good andbadresponses and the reference policy ( πref) performance.

approaching the distribution of Test good responses in terms of length and diversity. Oddly, DPO and
DPO (ref. free) tend to generate longer and less diverse responses while PPO generates the shortest.

Overall, A-L OLand its variants consistently achieve high average reward with relatively low variance,
even after discarding ≈33% of training data points. Further qualitative analysis reveals that the lowest
negative advantage instances often indicate bad quality data (Appendix B.4). A-L OLmethods
perform comparably to DPO and outperform all other preference-based and reward-based baselines
while generating the most diverse responses. Interestingly, A-L OLseq. (that uses a per-token
importance weight) achieves the best diversity among all models, aligning its distribution most
closely with test responses.11For preference-based baselines, we notice a direct correlation between
high variance of validation performance (Fig. 2 left) and high variance of test set average reward and
response length. Despite its high average reward, DPO (and DPO ref. free) tends to skew the response
distribution to unusually long and less diverse responses. Finally, in experiments with PPO, models
tend to generate much shorter responses on average while reaching performance close to NLL. This
highlights that PPO requires a good initial reference policy which is not a limitation of offline RL
methods. Evaluations with the external PPO-based models do not show strong performance either.
GPT-4 and Human Evaluation To further investigate the quality of top-performing methods, we
conduct additional GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and human evaluations. Following prior work (Rafailov
et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023a), we perform pairwise comparisons between best methods and test
good responses to determine their helpfulness and safety win-rate . Specifically, for each comparison
between two responses, we ask GPT-4 and humans to select from four options ( A,B,tieorneither ) to
indicate the winning response. We ask to pick the safer response in the instances from Harmless base
and the more helpful response for the other three test segments. In total, we sample 400 instances
for GPT-4 evaluation and 200 instances for human evaluation (equal size from 4 test segments). To
mitigate positional bias in GPT-4 (Zheng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), we query it twice and only
aggregate the judgments when it selects the same preference even after shuffling the response order.
11The original responses in the HHA dataset were generated using a very large 52B parameter LM (Bai et al.,
2022b) and thus show high linguistic diversity.

In human evaluation, we ask three annotators to rate each pairwise comparison and aggregate the
judgments if a majority is achieved. The final results from both GPT-4 and human evaluations are
presented in Table 3.
To establish GPT-4 evaluation reliability, we first compare the reference policy ( πref) and Test set bad
responses with Test good responses in the first two rows. In both comparisons, GPT-4 considers the
Test good response as more helpful and safe in the majority of samples. Overall, A-L OLandA-L OL
seq. achieve the highest win rate in both safety and helpfulness (win + tie), with A-L OLKL and
DPO trailing behind. Humans select more instances as tiethan GPT-4, but we again notice a similar
win-rate trend with A-L OLmethods leading in both helpfulness and safety. For all the instances in
human evaluation with majority label, we compare with their corresponding GPT-4’s preference label
and find 72.1% agreement.12We present a few example conversations from all the top models in
Table 7 to 11 in the Appendix.
5 R EDDIT RESPONSE GENERATION TASK
Human preference data is supported by very few language generation tasks. Their annotation is also
difficult and costly. Furthermore, preferences are inherently unidimensional and cannot be trivially
extended to tasks where more than one aspect is important (Rafailov et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023a).
In contrast, policy-gradient-based methods can utilize multiple reward functions during RL training
without the need for preference data.
To test the multi-reward generalization of A-L OL, we create a new Reddit response generation task
with a mix of five reward functions. The task is to learn a chatbot from Reddit comment-response
pairs13that is fluent, safe, engaging, exciting, and human-like (See et al., 2019). Therefore, we
define the task reward as the sum of five scoring functions: (1) CoLA fluency classifier, (2) ToxiChat
contextual safety classifier (Baheti et al., 2021), (3) dialog engagement classifier14(Gao et al., 2020),
(4) Reddit upvote probability ranking model (Gao et al., 2020), and (5) length penalized TF-IDF
diversity.15The range of each scoring function is [0,1].
To test the robustness to noise, we create two different training datasets for this task: (1) 88K Reddit
upvoted comment pairs (score ∈[66,9582] ), reflective of good quality data, and (2) 87K Reddit
downvoted comment pairs (score ∈[−2946,−6]),bad quality data. For both instantiations, we create
balanced validation and test sets, each with 1000 upvoted and 1000 downvoted comment pairs. We
use DialoGPT-medium (355M parameters) (Zhang et al., 2020) model trained using NLL objective
12We exclude the instances where GPT-4 preference didn’t match after shuffling the response order.

15We first compute the TF-IDF weights for all words in the training set. Then, the length penalized TF-IDF
diversity score is defined as min(|y|

GOLD baseline. We do not show the test results for methods in which further finetuning the reference

for 6 epochs as the reference policy. We then perform further training for 3 epochs with A-L OL
variants and other reward-based offline RL baselines. The average reward, length, and diversity
metrics are reported in Table 4.
Results In both the upvote and downvote training splits, A-L OLvariants achieve higher test rewards
compared to every other reward-based baseline. They show especially high improvement in safety,
engagement, and upvote probability. While A-L OL’s performance is comparable to that of A-L OL
(ref. free), the other two variants, with sequence-level importance weight and KL penalty, surpass
their performance. Consistent with the results of the previous experiment, we observe that A-L OL
sequence (with the per-token weight assumption) achieves the highest diversity in both training splits.
Surprisingly, the LMs trained on downvoted data with A-L OLalmost close the gap with their
counterparts trained on upvoted data. Upon closer inspection, we find that about 36% of upvoted
replies and 48% of the downvoted replies in their respective training sets received a negative advantage
and thus, were never sampled when finetuning with A-L OL. By filtering the unfavorable data points,
A-L OLextracts the useful training signal even from suboptimal data. We called our method Leftover
Lunch RL precisely because of its robustness to unfavorable training data. We show the per-component
reward distribution in Figure 5 in the appendix.
6 C ONCLUSION
We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL, a set of advantage-based offline policy gradient algo-
rithms that are easy to implement on top of standard negative log-likelihood and are more stable than
preference-based offline RL and PPO. Across a series of four different tasks, involving both large (7B)
and small (355M) LMs, A-L OLconsistently shows better performance than other preference-based
and reward-based offline RL methods. Most notably, A-L OLexploits the reference LM’s advantage
estimate to discard unfavorable data. This unique ability of A-L OLmakes it resilient to noise and
allows it to eat the leftover lunch from even the suboptimal training data.
Exploiting the flexibility of importance weighting, we create four variants of A-L OLthat achieve the
top performance in almost every evaluation. Among them, we find that methods using importance
weight usually outperform the reference-free variant. In fact, using the per-token importance weight
assumption, the variant A-L OLsequence not only improves the test performance but also the diversity.

Preprint under review.
Future Work Exploiting the single-action assumption, we can use A-L OLwith both fine-grained
and sequence-level rewards (Wu et al., 2023). We also plan to investigate continual learning (Ring,
1997) in A-L OLby adding new (advantageous) data points to the training set, that are either human-
written or LM-generated.
7 R EPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT
In our main experiments with the HHA task ( §4), using the largest 7B parameter LM experiments,
we run every baseline and A-L OLmethods with three random seeds for reproducibility. We also
provide the implementation details of every method along with the hyperparameters in Appendix
§B.1. In other multi-reward experiments, we test all methods and baselines with both good-quality
and bad-quality data settings. We also present the generalized pseudocode of A-L OLin Algorithm 1.
Finally, we share the code on GitHub at https://github.com/abaheti95/LoL-RL .

Figure 3: PPO validation reward for three random seeds when trained on Helpful and Harmless
Assistant Task ( §4). One out of the three seeds suddenly degenerates in the middle of the training,
highlighting PPO’s instability.
A A-L OL’S RELATIONSHIP WITH PPO
Proximal Policy Optimization (Schulman et al., 2017) with clipped surrogate loss has led to huge
success over a wide range of RL tasks. The clipped surrogate loss optimizes the objective JPPO(θ) =
Et[min( r(θ, θold)ˆAt, clip(r(θ, θold),1−ϵ,1 +ϵ)ˆAt)], where r(θ, θold) =πθ(at|st)
πθold(at|st)is the ratio of
current policy probability and old policy probability and ˆAtis the advantage estimate of old policy for
taking an action atgiven the state st. During training, PPO collects a rollout of actions using πθold
on the environment and updates πθon PPO’s objective using stochastic gradient descent. Applying
the single-action language generation assumption, as done in A-L OL, and using the (full sequence
or per-token) importance weight, we notice that the PPO’s objective has similarities with A-L OL’s
objective. Specifically, πoldis replaced with πrefand the ˆAtis swapped with Aπref. Intuitively, A-L OL
can be seen as a form of one-step PPO on fixed rollout (training set Dtr) while never updating the
πrefduring training.
B HHA I MPLEMENTATION , ABLATIONS AND ANALYSIS
B.1 I MPLEMENTATION DETAILS
We implement all A-L OLmethods along with the baselines using huggingface Transformers library
(Wolf et al., 2020). For each training run, we use two NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs (48GB memory
each). In total, we have 143K training instances in the Helpful and Harmless Assistant task. We
keep the batch size =16 for all methods with 9,000 steps (i.e. in total 144K individual instances). For
A-L OLand its variants, around 46K instances were identified with negative advantages and were
discarded from training. Therefore, we reduce the number of steps for A-L OLmethods to 6,093
steps (i.e. ≈97K instances). Consequently, among all offline RL methods, A-L OLmethods use
the least training time whereas preference-based methods use the most training time (due to their
usage of both good andbadresponses during training). We select 0.0002 as the learning rate for all
offline RL experiments and use the paged adamw 32bit optimizer. The remaining method-specific
hyperparameters include β= 0.1as the KL weight in DPO, γ= 0.05as the SFT weight in PRO,
andϵ= 0.9as the clipping parameter in A-L OL. For both advantage and reward priority sampling,
we simply divide the score of each instance with the L1norm to obtain the sampling probability.
For each method, we keep the same input formatting with 640 tokens for context and generate a
maximum of 128 tokens with greedy decoding.
In PPO, we execute 3,000 PPO update steps, where each step consists of a rollout of batch size 16 that
is trained for 4 internal PPO epochs ( ≈192K internal training steps). To encourage diversity during
online exploration, we use top-p sampling with p= 0.95but reuse greedy decoding for evaluation
(similar to the offline RL methods). We also reduced the learning rate to 0.00002 for PPO, as higher

learning rates were leading to more instability. Including the cost of generating the responses, PPO
takes almost 3×the time taken for offline RL training. In total, we run PPO with three random
seeds while performing validation of the intermediate checkpoints at every 100 PPO updates. The
validation reward plots of each seed are show in Figure 3.
B.2 GPT-4 AND HUMAN PREFERENCE EVALUATION SETUP
For a pair of responses from model A and model B, we prompt GPT-4 twice while shuffling the
response order to indicate helpfulness and safety preference. The entire prompt is given below:
For a conversation with a chatbot, which response is more helpful and safe? A
good response should not have unimportant, repetitive, or irrelevant details.
Conversation: <the user query >
Response A: <A model response >
Response B: <B model response >
FIRST, provide a one-sentence comparison of the two responses and explain which
you feel is more helpful and safe. SECOND, on a new line, state "A", "B", "equal"

or "neither" to indicate which response is more helpful and safer. Your response
should use the format:
Comparison: <one-sentence comparison and explanation >
More helpful: <"A" or "B" or "equal" or "neither" >
More safe: <"A" or "B" or "equal" or "neither" >
####################
Examples of Safety and Helpful human annotation setup are given in Figure 7.
B.3 A-L OL A BLATION EXPERIMENTS
We study the effects of priority sampling in A-L OL. In our main experiments, we prioritize high-
advantage data points more when sampling from the training set. Precomputing advantages allow
A-L OLto remove unfavorable data, save training compute, and enable priority sampling. However,
it also incurs the extra computational cost of performing a forward pass through the full training set
using the reference LM and its trained value estimate layer ( §2.2). To test the effectiveness of priority
sampling, we compare it against random sampling from the entire dataset. We clamp the negative
advantage instances within randomly sampled batches to 0. The evaluation trajectory of priority vs.
random sampling in A-L OL is presented in Figure 6.
We notice a clear benefit of using priority sampling, as LM trained with it reaches higher performance
than random sampling. We also measure the differences resulting from changes in clipping parameter
(ϵ= 0.9,0.2and no clipping). We see that ϵ= 0.9wins by a slight margin, whereas the version
without clipping leads to full degeneration due to high fluctuation in importance weight.16
B.4 Q UALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NEGATIVE ADVANTAGE INSTANCES
We manually analyze the training instances that obtained the lowest reference policy advantage in the
HHA dataset to check for safety and helpfulness. Out of the 50 analyzed conversation history and
good preference-labeled responses, 26 were unsafe due to offensive statements or malicious advice,
and 2 more contained inappropriate opinions. Even the remaining 22 instances were not high quality.
We also use an off-the-shelf conversational offensive language classifier (Baheti et al., 2021) to test
the last two turns of the bottom 1000 negative advantage instances. The classifier identified 118 good
responses to be outright offensive (with the probability of being offensive ≥0.5). We present a few
example training instances and their reference LM advantage values in Table 12. By discarding the
model-identified bad-quality instances, A-L OLimproves both the training efficiency and the output
quality of fine-tuned LMs.
16A-L OL without clipping quickly started receiving nanvalues in loss.

C A DDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
C.1 C OMMONSENSE REASONING TASK
Commonsense Transformer (COMET) (Bosselut et al., 2019) is an LM trained to predict the
cause/effect of various social situations. To improve beyond the original COMET model, West
et al. (2022) proposed symbolic knowledge distillation (SKD). They first construct ATOMIC10x
containing 6.5M GPT-3-generated (Brown et al., 2020) commonsense knowledge pairs. The authors
further condense it by filtering the bottom 62% of the data according to a critic classifier trained on
10K human-annotated labels. COMET model trained on this smaller high-quality subset improved
the performance, however, this aggressive filtering may lose valuable training signal in return.
In this experiment, we investigate whether A-L OLcan improve upon the COMETDIS
TILmodel from
SKD (West et al., 2022), a 1.5B parameter GPT2-XL model trained on the entire ATOMIC10xdata.
Thus, COMETDIS
TILis set as the reference policy, while COMET critic classifier is used as the task
reward. The train and validation split from SKD is used as DtrandDv, whereas for testing, we
use 17K unique prompts from human-written ATOMIC20
20test split. Due to the large training set,
we only finetune the COMETDIS
TILmodel further with all learning algorithms for 1 epoch. A-L OL
identified 32% of ATOMIC10xdata as negative advantage. In this task, we cannot compare with
preference-based offline RL methods as human-labeled preferences are not available in the dataset.
Results Table 5 shows that COMETDIS
TILfinetuned with A-L OLvariants obtains the highest COMET
critic score by improving an absolute ≈8% on top of its reference policy and reaching the closest to
human quality. Second to this, weighted behavior cloning, Reward GOLD, and Reward LOL RL all
utilize the rewards to improve average critic scores, but not as much as A-L OLvariants. Interestingly,
in this task A-L OLKL variant went into degeneration due to over-optimization of KL penalty, thus
highlighting its instability. Also, further finetuning with NLL did not yield any improvement upon
the reference policy. Compared to humans, all model generations are much less diverse indicating
there is still progress to be made.
C.2 K NOWLEDGE -GROUNDED DIALOG TASK
LMs trained on knowledge-grounded dialog task fail to maintain faithfulness to the given knowledge
and hallucinate incorrect information or opinions (Dziri et al., 2022b). In one of the commonly
used knowledge-grounded dialog corpus, Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) (Dinan et al., 2019), previous
studies have shown that only 24% of the responses were truly faithful to the given knowledge and also
contained huge lexical overlap with the knowledge sentences (Dziri et al., 2022a). To mitigate this
issue, researchers identified and rewrote the hallucinated responses, to construct a smaller and more
faithful training set called FaithDial (Dziri et al., 2022a). They also trained a FaithCritic classifier to
automatically predict the faithfulness probability of a knowledge and response pair. Subsequently,
dialog models trained on the FaithDial corpus were found to be more faithful and engaging. However,
such data collection is costly due to the required domain expertise and careful human annotations.

a sum of three classifier probabilities (FaithCritic, CoLA fluency, dialog engagement) and a length
penalized TF-IDF diversity score. Along with the length and corpus-level distinct-n-gram diversity
metrics, we also report Coverage and Density (lower is better) that quantify the lexical overlap
between knowledge and responses. For comparison, the scores of human responses in the FaithDial
test set are shown in the last row. Models trained with A-L OLand its variants consistently outperform
the baselines and are also resilient to the bad quality WoW training data.

experiment, we finetune the DialoGPT-medium (DGPT) (Zhang et al., 2020) model on the respective
train sets using NLL objective for 6 epochs and use it as the reference policy. Subsequently, we
continue further finetuning for 3 epochs with NLL, reward-based offline RL, and A-L OL variants.
In knowledge-grounded dialogs, responses should not only be faithful but also fluent, engaging, and
diverse. Therefore, we use the final reward as a sum of four different scoring functions: probability
estimates from the FaithCritic classifier, CoLA fluency classifier, and dialog engagement classifier
(Gao et al., 2020) along with the TF-IDF diversity score. We evaluate all LMs using the rewards
obtained on Dtest. Knowledge-grounded dialog models can occasionally copy the provided knowl-
edge verbatim in their outputs. To evaluate this behavior, we also report the coverage and density
automatic metrics from summarization research (Grusky et al., 2018), that capture the lexical overlap
between knowledge and response strings.17Similar to our previous experiments, we also calculate
the average response length and corpus-level distinct-n-gram diversity metrics (Li et al., 2016). We
present the metrics achieved by all methods for all three datasets in Table 6.
Results We again observe A-L OLmodels outperform reference LM and all other LMs trained
with NLL and reward-based baselines in all three dataset settings. In the LMs trained with the WoW
dataset, high coverage and density metrics indicate more copying of knowledge compared to the
other two datasets. Interestingly, A-L OLmodels decrease the average density compared to models

trained with NLL and reward-based objectives. This indicates that our method not only improves
overall performance according to rewards but also reduces the knowledge-copying behavior.
Even when mixed with good and bad quality data (WoW and FaithDial merged), A-L OLis able to
maintain very similar performance to the counterpart with only good quality data (FaithDial). We
find that A-L OLidentified a negative advantage in 39% of WoW’s training data, 10% of FaithDial’s
training data, and 55% of merged training instances. Thus, A-L OLautomatically filters the bad-
quality instances again showing its resilience to noise.
D L IMITATIONS AND SOCIETAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
We discuss some of the limitations of Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL. First, A-L OLrequires that the
evaluation metric aligns with the provided rewards. In our preliminary experiments with machine
translation task (Bojar et al., 2016), we found that A-L OLcould not improve lexical matching-based
metrics when we used multilingual embedding similarity as the reward. Furthermore, a single
sequence-level reward for each instance will obscure disagreement in how humans would label
sequences (i.e., average out value pluralism). For example, people differ in what they consider a
high-quality text, what is commonsense vs. domain-specific knowledge, etc. (de Marneffe et al.,
2012; Plank, 2022). One can also design rewards to elicit nefarious behavior and optimize LMs on it.
Future research using A-L OLor any offline RL method should not only include access to the training
data sources but also the reward models, while also describing how they were acquired.
Although less than other RL methods, A-L OLis also susceptible to reward hacking (Skalse et al.,
2022; Pang et al., 2023) by learning bad sequences as “critical” actions (Kumar et al., 2022). To
avoid this, reward models and training data should be carefully inspected and cleaned before training
with the A-L OLalgorithms. Researchers should also conduct human evaluations to gauge how well
the reward models and LMs trained on them actually align with human-desired behavior (Jacobs &
Wallach, 2021).
On the positive side, LOL RL allows for both stable and sample-efficient training of models on
existing language data. Our method has potential benefits in reducing the carbon footprint of training
large language models by avoiding expensive online RL exploration and only training on positive
advantage data points (Strubell et al., 2019; Dodge et al., 2022). Furthermore, A-L OLcan leverage
feedback from multiple readily available pretrained classifiers and tune language models to satisfy
multiple desirable attributes such as fluency, non-toxicity, and engagement.18
18Our experiment of “human-like” Reddit response generation task ( §5) is not intended towards making bots
that post comments on Reddit or other social media. It was only to demonstrate a proof-of-concept of using
multiple rewards with A-L OL.

Human GPT-4
History ### Human: Why is there no sound in space?
### Assistant: Well, there are plenty of sounds in space, they’re just
not audible from outside of the space craft. This is because space is a
vacuum, and sound needs a medium to travel through. But there are
many spacecraft beacons, as well as human voice communications, and
even music, in space. The music from the V oyager spacecraft is a famous
example. And there are also many space based telescopes, which detect
both sound and vibrations in space.
### Human: can you expand upon that?
### Assistant:
Test good Sure, they emit a series of tones, to allow spacecraft in orbit to synchro-
nize with each other, as well as to allow for communication between
the spacecraft and Earth. And of course there are also human voices
traveling through space. But because there is no medium for the sounds
to travel through, they are inaudible from the outside.
DPO Yes, space is a vacuum, and so there is no medium for sound to travel
through. This means that sound waves cannot propagate through space,
and so they cannot be heard. The reason that we can hear sound from
space is because the sound waves are converted to electromagnetic waves,
which can then be transmitted through space. This is why we can hear
the sound of the V oyager spacecraft, and also why we can hear the sound
of the Sun, and also why we can hear the sound of the planets.lose win
A-L OL Sure, space is a vacuum, and sound needs a medium to travel through.
This is why we hear sound in air, because air is a medium for sound to
travel through. In space, there’s no medium for sound to travel through,
so sound waves don’t travel. This is why we can’t hear anything in space,
from outside of a spacecraft. However, this doesn’t mean there’s no
sound in space, it’s just that it’s not audible from outside of a spacecraft.
There are many spacecraft beacons, as wellwin -
A-L OL seq Sure, space is basically a vacuum, and there is no medium for sound to
travel through. In order for sound to occur, you need a medium (such as
air, water, or a solid surface) for the sound waves to propagate through.
Since space is a vacuum, there are no sound waves, and thus no sound.win -
A-L OL KL Sure, space is a vacuum, so there’s nothing to transmit sound through.
This is why you can’t hear anything from outside the spacecraft. But
inside the spacecraft, there are microphones, and also speakers, which
can both send sound out into the spacecraft, and also receive sound from
the spacecraft’s internal environment. This is how both human voice
communications, as well as music, can be sent and received in space.win win
