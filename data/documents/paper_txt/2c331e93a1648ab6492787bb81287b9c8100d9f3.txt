Abstract: The cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity and aerosol chemical composition were
concurrently measured via a scanning mobility CCN analyzer (SMCA) and an Aerodyne Time-
of-Flight Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM), respectively, during wintertime 2022 in
Beijing, China. During the observation period, the mean CCN number concentrations ranged from
1345±1270 cm−3at SS = 0.1% to 3267 ±2325 cm−3at SS = 0.3%. The mean critical activation
diameters ( D50) at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were 172 ±13 nm, 102±8 nm, and 84±7 nm,
corresponding to the average hygroscopicity parameters ( κCCN) of 0.34, 0.33, and 0.26, respectively.
The diurnal variations in D50suggested that the local primary emissions signiﬁcantly enhanced D50
at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had less inﬂuence on D50at SS = 0.1% due to the limited size (<150 nm)
of particles emitted from primary sources. As PM 2.5concentration increases, the dominant driver
of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. At a speciﬁc SS, D50decreased with increases in
the degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal mixing degree during atmospheric
aging was beneﬁcial to CCN activation. In this study, the commonly used f44 (or O:C) was weakly
correlated with κorgand failed to describe the variations in κorg. Instead, the variations in κorg
can be well parameterized with the Org/BC ratio. The correlation between κderived from bulk
chemical compositions and CCN measurements was substantially improved when this κorgscheme
was adopted, emphasizing the importance of considering κorgvariations on deriving κchem from
aerosol chemical composition.

1. Introduction
Aerosol particles can serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) under supersaturation
(SS) conditions [ 1,2], participating in cloud processes and altering the microphysical and
optical properties of clouds, which indirectly affect the global climate [ 3,4]. The Sixth
Assessment Report from IPCC (2021) highlighted that aerosol indirect effects remain the
most considerable uncertainty in evaluating the anthropogenic contribution on current
and future climate change [ 5]. Remote sensing has been widely used to study aerosol–
cloud–climate interactions and provide extensive datasets. However, it is difﬁcult to
identify the proportion of CCN from retrieved total aerosol concentration (CCN activation

ratio), which would introduce uncertainties in estimating aerosol-related effects on cloud
microphysics based on remote sensing. Furthermore, accurate retrievals of cloud droplet
number concentrations ( Nd) using remote sensing measurements is challenging. Based
on the ground-level measurements of aerosol activation properties and parcel theory, the
Ndfor non-precipitating Planetary Boundary Layer clouds can be derived. Then, the
parameters of the retrieval can be optimized through the closure analysis on Ndobtained
from remote sensing data and in situ measurement at ground level [6].
The ability of aerosol particles to participate in cloud processes, known as CCN activity,
is one of critical parameters in studying the indirect radiation effects and environmental
impacts of aerosols. At a given SS condition, the CCN activity is mainly determined by their
size distribution, chemical composition, and mixing state [ 7–9]. Previous studies suggested
that the size distribution of aerosols is a more critical factor than their chemical composition
in governing CCN activity [ 2,10]. However, the impact of chemical composition on CCN
activity signiﬁcantly increases in situations with low supersaturation [ 11,12]. The classical
Köhler theory [ 1], combining the Raoult’s law effect with the Kelvin effect, illustrates that
the aerosol particle activation depends on particle size, chemical composition, and SS. Pet-
ters and Kreidenweis [ 13] developed a single hygroscopicity parameter κin parameterizing
the Raoult term, which enabled the quantiﬁcation of CCN activity without requiring infor-
mation of the dissolved compounds. However, ambient aerosols are complex mixtures, and
their sizes and compositions vary at different stages of atmospheric aging process [ 14–16],
which include numerous primary and secondary organic components as well. These impose
various effects on particle activation behavior and reduce the applicability of the Köhler
theory in describing the actual atmospheric aerosols, especially for organic aerosols (OA).
Earlier studies speciﬁcally focused on parametrizing the empirical correlations between
the OA oxidation level and organic hygroscopicity parameter ( κorg) [17–21], suggesting
a linear correlation between κorgand the oxygen-to-carbon atomic ratio (O:C). However,
the systematic variability in parametrizations between κorgand the O:C ratio determined
from the different studies remains large [ 22]. Kuang et al. (2021) recently pointed out
that secondary OA (SOA) from different precursors and formation processes may result
in SOA with different chemical composition, functional properties, and microphysical
structure, consequently exerting distinct inﬂuences on κorgand rendering single oxidation
level parameters (such as O:C) unable to capture those differences [23].
To obtain regional parameters for aerosol particle activation, numerous ﬁeld cam-
paigns have been conducted globally. Alongside the considerable spatial heterogeneity,
temporal variability in aerosol activation characteristics is also essential for accurate CCN
prediction [ 7]. The CCN activity can be characterized by two important parameters: activa-
tion critical diameter ( D50) and activation ratio (AR). These two parameters can be directly
measured through combining cloud condensation nuclei counter (CCNc) and scanning
mobility particle sizer (SMPS) [ 24,25], and can also be determined by aerosol chemical
composition and particle number size distribution (PNSD) measurements using the Köhler
equation and internal mixture hypothesis [ 20,26–28]. The CCN activity closure analysis,
based on the above two methods, is a key means of investigating the impacts of aerosol
properties on activation processes. Although CCN measurements were conducted under
different environments in the North China Plain, only a few studies established a linkage
between CCN activity and chemical composition with a high time resolution [ 27,29–31].
Additionally, due to the Clean Air Action of the Chinese government initiated in 2013,
stringent emission controls have been imposed to decrease ﬁne particulate matter pollution
(PM 2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 µm in diameter) [ 32]. In the Beijing region, notable reduc-
tions in PM 2.5concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by signiﬁcant
changes in its chemical composition [ 33–35]. Instead of organics and sulfate, organics and
nitrate are now the dominant components of Beijing winter haze pollution. Therefore, more
investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN
activity in urban Beijing.

In this study, the CCN activity and aerosol chemical composition were simultaneously
measured in Beijing wintertime, using a scanning mobility CCN analyzer (SMCA) and
an Aerodyne aerosol chemical species monitor (ACSM). An overview of the observation
data is presented in Section Overview the Observation Data. The impacts of aerosol
chemical composition and mixing state on CCN activity are discussed in Section 4.1.
Finally, in Section 4.2, through closure analysis of the aerosol hygroscopicity derived from
CCN activity and chemical composition, we estimate κorgand parameterize it with the
concentration ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC).
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Measurement Site
Measurements of size-resolved CCN activity, aerosol size distribution and composition
(organics, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, chloride, and black carbon) were conducted on the
rooftop of the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) building during the
period of 15 January–3 March 2022. All aerosol measurements were performed downstream
of a PM 10impactor. The ambient air passes through the impactor and then enters the
automatic regenerating adsorption aerosol dryer (TROPOS, Leipzig, Germany), which can
dry the sample air to a low RH (RH < 30%) to ensure comparability of measurements [ 36].
The measurement site (116◦19′E, 39◦57′N, approximately 53 m above the ground) is located
in a trafﬁc-intensive area of the west 3rd ring road in Beijing, China, which represents the
urban environment inﬂuenced by intense anthropogenic emissions [37,38].
2.2. Instrumentation
2.2.1. Size-Resolved CCN Activity and PNSD Measurements
Size-resolved CCN spectra and activation ratios were measured using the SMCA
initially proposed by Moore et al. (2010) [ 39]. In this work, the SMCA consisted of a CCNc-
100 (DMT Inc., Blouder, CO, USA), a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, model 3081,
TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), and a condensation particle counter (CPC, model 3772, TSI
Inc.). In the SMCA system, the combined DMA and CPC were used as a SMPS during the
measurements. The dry particles after the diffusion dryer were neutralized by the X-ray
neutralizer and were subsequently classiﬁed by the DMA in a scanning mode. Then, the
particles were split into two streams: one to the CPC for measurement of total particle
number concentration ( NCN) and another to the CCNc-100 for measurements of the CCN
number concentration ( NCCN). The ﬂow rates of the CPC and CCNc-100 were 1.0 L min−1
and 0.5 L min−1, respectively. With the total sample ﬂow of 1.5 L min−1and sheath ﬂow
of 7.5 L min−1, the SMCA was protocolled to measure particles at a mobility diameter
range of 8–360 nm. The DMA was operated in scanning mode with a time resolution of
180 s, including a scan time of 165 s and a retrace time of 15 s. The supersaturation in the
CCNc-100 was set to be 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, respectively, with a time interval of 9 min
(corresponding to three diameter scans of the DMA) for each SS during the experiment.
Only the second scan for each SS is used as the CCNc needs time for SS stabilization.
Therefore, a complete SS cycle lasted ~0.5 h. The CCNc-100 was regularly calibrated with
ammonium sulfate particles at the four SSs (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.7%).
2.2.2. Aerosol Chemical Composition Measurement
Non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM) including sulfate, nitrate, ammonium,
and organics with dry aerodynamic diameters below 2.5 µm was measured by an ACSM
equipped with a PM 2.5aerodynamic lens at 10 min time resolution. The ACSM data were
analyzed using standard data analysis software (Tofware v2.5.13). The collection efﬁciency
(CE), which accounts for particle loss due to bouncing off the standard vaporizer, was
derived from composition-dependent calculation following the algorithms proposed by
Middlebrook et al. (2012) [ 40]. The calibrations of ionization efﬁciency (IE) and relative ion-
ization efﬁciencies (RIEs) followed the standard procedures described in previous studies
by using 300–350 nm pure ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate particles [41,42] . The
Remote Sens. 2023 ,15, 4119 4 of 15
RIE values used for organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride were 1.4, 1.2, 1.1,
3.4, and 1.3, respectively.
Equivalent black carbon (eBC) mass was measured with an aethalometer (AE33,
MAGEE Scientiﬁc, Berkeley, CA, USA) at 1 min. The instruments used dual-dots conﬁgura-
tion to auto-correct for the loading effect. The measured absorption was converted to BC
mass using an apparent mass absorption cross section (MAC) of 7.7 m2g−1at a wavelength
of 880 nm [ 43]. The λ= 880 nm is chosen to avoid the potential interference of brown carbon
at shorter wavelength. The multi-scattering enhancement factor (C value) of 2.88 at 880nm
wavelength was used to exclude the multiple light scattering effects.
In addition, PM 2.5mass concentration data from air quality monitoring station (Wanliu)
operated by the Beijing Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau were used, which
is located in the northwest and northeast direction of the CAMS observation site, with a
distance of approximately 3 km. The concurrent meteorological parameters (including
wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, and air temperature) are from the national
surface meteorological observation stations of the China Meteorological Administration.
2.3. Data Processing
2.3.1. CCN Activation
TheNCNandNCCN data were used to calculate the size-resolved CCN activation ratio
(AR), which deﬁned as the ratio of NCCN toNCNat each particle size ( NCCN/NCNvs.Dp).
The inﬂuence of multiple-charge particles and DMA transfer function on AR were corrected
basing on a modiﬁed algorithm developed by Hagen and Alofs (1983) [ 44] and Deng et al.
(2011, 2013) [ 25,45]. Figure S1 gives a typical example of NCCN/NCNvs.Dpduring the
experiment, and the AR curve can be obtained by ﬁtting the NCCN/NCNratio with the
sigmoidal function:
AR=a+b/(1+exp (D50−Dp
σs)) (1)
where ais the offset from 0 in the y direction and bis the height of the upper plateau of
the sigmoid function, D50is the critical diameter, and σsis a measure for the width of
the sigmoid function. D50is also called the critical diameter or the activation diameter,
that is, the diameter at which 50% of the particles are activated at a speciﬁc SS. The
variation in D50at a given SS can be attributed to the variation in the number fraction
of hygroscopic particles or its hygroscopicity, which can be indicated the CCN activity
of a particle population. Then, the hygroscopicity parameter κCCN, derived from CCN
measurements, is calculated from the critical supersaturation ratio ( Sc) and D50from the
following equation [13]:
κCCN =4A3
27D3
50(lnSc)2, A=4σs/aMw
RTρw(2)
where σs/ais the surface tension of the solution/air interface and the solution is temporarily
assumed to be pure water (0.0728 N m−1at 298.15 K), Mwis the molecular weight of water,
Ris the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol−1K−1),Tis absolute temperature, ρwis the
density of water.
The steepness of the AR curve represents the degree of external mixture or the
heterogeneity of aerosol chemical composition, which can be quantiﬁed by the ratio of
(D75−D25)/D50[46].D75andD25correspond to the diameters at which 75% and 25% of
the particles are activated on the AR curve. Internal mixture implies that particles at any
given dry size have equal κwith ( D75−D25)/D50= 0. Alternatively, various κat a given
particle size indicate externally mixed aerosol compositions with higher ( D75−D25)/Dc
values. Although the sigma term from sigmoid ﬁt has been used in previous studies to
estimate aerosol mixing state [ 19,30], the ( D75−D25) value can provide a more accurate
representation of aerosol mixing state. This is because the CCN measurement uncertainties
would be larger due to the extremely low concentration of activated particles at the low
Remote Sens. 2023 ,15, 4119 5 of 15
AR range. In addition, the relationship between activation ratio and particle size exhibits
nonlinear behavior when AR < 25% or >75% (Figure S1). In contrast, within the particle size
range of D25toD75, the AR increases rapidly and exhibits a relatively linear relationship
with the particle size. The sigma term represents the width of entire particle diameter
range used in sigmoid ﬁt. Instead of the sigma term, using the ( D75−D25)/D50value to
describe the steepness of the AR curve can reduce the uncertainties in estimating aerosol
mixing state.
2.3.2. Aerosol Hygroscopicity Derived from Aerosol Chemical Composition
The hygroscopic parameter κis solely determined by composition and reﬂects the
Raoult term in Köhler theory [ 13]. By assuming internal mixing, the aerosol hygroscopic-
ity (κchem) can be derived from aerosol chemical composition measurements. The κchem
of aerosol particles with multiple compositions is contributed by the κof each volume-
weighted composition, following the Zdanovskii–Stokes–Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule [ 28],
expressed as:
κchem =∑iεiκi (3)
where irepresents the ith composition, εiis the volume fraction of each composition in
the bulk, and kiis the hygroscopic parameter for each composition present in a multiple-
composition particle. For the compositions determined by ACSM the AE33 measurements,
a simple ion-pairing scheme [9] was used in this study, expressed as:
nNH 4NO 3=nNO−

nH2SO4=max(
0,nSO2−

All species are then converted to volume by assuming a density. The density ( ρi) and
κivalues for all species used in this study are listed in Table 1 [ 15]. Here, a constant κof 0.1
is used for particulate organics [47,48].

3. Results
Overview the Observation Data
The time series of meteorological parameters (such as wind speed, wind direction,
ambient air temperature, and relative humidity (RH)), PM 2.5mass concentration, NCN, and
NCCN at SS of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% are shown in Figure 1. During the observation periods,
the wind speed was mainly less than 3 m s−1, with an average of 1.3 m s−1. The relatively
low wind speeds (<2 m s−1) were generally associated with southerly winds, whereas
higher wind speeds (>3 m s−1) corresponded to northerly winds. When persistent southerly
winds prevail (such as January 17–24th), the daily average PM 2.5concentration and RH
signiﬁcantly increased from 19 to 156 µg m−3, and from 31% to 77%, respectively. The
cumulative enhancement of PM 2.5concentrations was jointly inﬂuenced by local emissions,
regional transport, and liquid/heterogeneous reactions at different stages of this persistent

pollution episode [ 49]. The RH was below 60% for most of the time, with an average of
38±18%. The temperature ranged from −9 to 17◦C, with an average of 0.2 ±4.7◦C. These
meteorological parameters indicated relatively dry and cold weather conditions during
this campaign.

 RH signi ﬁcantly increased from 19 to 156 µg m−3, and from 31% to 77%, respectively. The 
cumulative enha ncement of PM 2.5 concentrations was jointly in ﬂuenced by local emis-
sions, regional transport, and li quid/heterogeneous reactions at di ﬀerent stages of this 
persistent pollution episode [49]. The RH wa s below 60% for most of the time, with an 
average of 38 ± 18%. The temperature ranged from −9 to 17 °C, with an average of 0.2 ± 4.7 
°C. These meteorological parameters indicated relatively dry and cold weather conditions 
during this campaign.

SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% during the campaign. 
The temporal variations in both aerosol number and mass concentration are shown 
in Figure 1c. The range of aerosol number concentration varied from ~1000 to 17,000 cm−3, 
with an average of 6714 ± 3117 cm−3. The PM 2.5 mass concentration ranged from 2 µg m−3 
to 197 µg m−3, with an average of 34 ± 39 µg m−3. During the most increasing stages of PM 2.5 
mass concentration, the aerosol number conc entration consistently varied with the mass 
concentration. However, when an intermi ttent fog event occurred from January 23rd to 
24th, the number concentration decreased with  the increasing mass concentration. This 
suggests that the wet scavenging e ﬀect of fog droplets substantially reduced aerosol num-
ber concentration, but enhanced liquid-phase reactions alternatively resulting in the in-
creases in mass concentration. The CCN concen tration at low supersaturations (0.1%) was 
signiﬁcantly lower than the two relatively higher supersaturations (0.2% and 0.3%) (Fig-
ure 1d), with average concentrations of 1345 ± 1270 cm−3, 2752 ± 2114 cm−3, and 3267 ± 2325 
cm−3, respectively. 
The time series of PM 2.5 chemical composition, dry particle number size distribution 
(PNSD), and D50 are given in Figure 2. The particle chemical composition is closely related 
to its hygroscopicity and activation characteri stics. The hygroscopic properties of aerosols 
are mainly determined by composition, with inorganics having higher hygroscopicity 
[9,50] than less water-soluble substances, such as BC [51,52] or primary organics [53]. At a 
given SS, particles with higher hygroscopicity are corresponding to smaller  D50, indicating 
such particles are more prone to activation and form cloud droplets. During the observa-
tion period, organic ma tter and nitrate were the most important components, with aver-
age percentages of 42.4% ± 11.9% and 21.5% ± 12.1%, respectively, followed by ammonium 
(18.4% ± 5.0%), sulfate (10.3% ± 7.3%), BC (5.0% ± 2.2%), and chloride (2.5% ± 1.8%), re-
spectively. Aerosol chemical composition had a remarkable variation with PM 2.5 concen-
tration levels, characterized by organics dominating at low PM 2.5 concentration levels (<25 
µg m−3) and nitrate gradually becoming the dominant composition with increases in PM 2.5 360

The temporal variations in both aerosol number and mass concentration are shown in
Figure 1c. The range of aerosol number concentration varied from ~1000 to 17,000 cm−3,
with an average of 6714 ±3117 cm−3. The PM 2.5mass concentration ranged from 2µg m−3
to 197 µg m−3, with an average of 34 ±39µg m−3. During the most increasing stages
of PM 2.5mass concentration, the aerosol number concentration consistently varied with
the mass concentration. However, when an intermittent fog event occurred from January
23rd to 24th, the number concentration decreased with the increasing mass concentration.
This suggests that the wet scavenging effect of fog droplets substantially reduced aerosol
number concentration, but enhanced liquid-phase reactions alternatively resulting in the
increases in mass concentration. The CCN concentration at low supersaturations (0.1%)
was signiﬁcantly lower than the two relatively higher supersaturations (0.2% and 0.3%)
(Figure 1d), with average concentrations of 1345 ±1270 cm−3, 2752±2114 cm−3, and
3267±2325 cm−3, respectively.
The time series of PM 2.5chemical composition, dry particle number size distribution
(PNSD), and D50are given in Figure 2. The particle chemical composition is closely related
to its hygroscopicity and activation characteristics. The hygroscopic properties of aerosols
are mainly determined by composition, with inorganics having higher hygroscopicity [ 9,50]
than less water-soluble substances, such as BC [ 51,52] or primary organics [ 53]. At a given
SS, particles with higher hygroscopicity are corresponding to smaller D50, indicating such
particles are more prone to activation and form cloud droplets. During the observation
period, organic matter and nitrate were the most important components, with average
percentages of 42.4% ±11.9% and 21.5%±12.1%, respectively, followed by ammonium
(18.4%±5.0%), sulfate (10.3% ±7.3%), BC (5.0%±2.2%), and chloride (2.5% ±1.8%),
respectively. Aerosol chemical composition had a remarkable variation with PM 2.5con-
centration levels, characterized by organics dominating at low PM 2.5concentration levels
(<25 µg m−3) and nitrate gradually becoming the dominant composition with increases
in PM 2.5concentration. These characteristics of aerosol composition are consistent with
recent studies, which reported that nitrate is now the principal component of Beijing winter
haze pollution [ 33,34]. As a hygroscopic component, the increasing fraction of nitrate dur-

ing pollution episodes facilitates the enhancement of aerosol hygroscopicity and activity.
The time series of PNSD in Figure 2b shows that aerosol particles mainly concentrate in
nucleation mode ( Dp< 100 nm) during the clean periods. However, as the PM 2.5mass
concentration increases, there is a signiﬁcant increase in the proportion of particle numbers
in the accumulation mode, accompanied by a decrease in D50. The average D50at SS = 0.1%
(172±13 nm) was signiﬁcantly larger than that at SS = 0.2% (102 ±8 nm) and SS = 0.3%
(84±7 nm), indicating that the SS variation was more sensitive to D50at a lower SS range.

 concentration. These characteristics of aerosol composition are consistent with recent 
studies, which reported that nitrate is now the principal component of Beijing winter haze 
pollution [33,34]. As a hygroscopic component,  the increasing fraction of nitrate during 
pollution episodes facilitates the enhancement of aerosol hygroscopicity and activity. The 
time series of PNSD in Figure 2b shows that  aerosol particles mainly concentrate in nucle-
ation mode ( Dp < 100 nm) during the clean periods. However, as the PM 2.5 mass concen-
tration increases, there is a signi ﬁcant increase in the proportion of particle numbers in 
the accumulation mode, accompanied by a decrease in D50. The average D50 at SS = 0.1% 
(172 ± 13 nm) was signi ﬁcantly larger than that at SS = 0.2% (102 ± 8 nm) and SS = 0.3% (84 
± 7 nm), indicating that the SS variation was more sensitive to D50 at a lower SS range.

The diurnal variations in D50 at diﬀerent SS, the mass fraction of m/z 44 in organic 
mass spectrum ( f44), aerosol chemical composition, and PNSD are given in Figure 3. The 
sources and properties of aerosol particles vary with di ﬀerent size ranges, leading to a 
diverse diurnal variation in D50 at diﬀerent SS (Figure 3a–c). As a typical tracer for SOA 
formation, the f44 can be associated with OA hygroscopicity owing to their positive cor-
relations reported in previous studies [54,55]. Both f44 and the sum fraction of hygroscopic 
inorganic components (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium) had a noticeable peak in the af-
ternoon (Figure 3d,e), implying they were signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by photochemical oxi-
dation in the daytime. Meanwhile, the minimum of D50 for all three SS conditions occurred 
around 15:00, corresponding to the diurnal peak time of f44 and the fraction of inorganic 
components. This suggests photochemical reac tions on daily basis played an important 
role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity.

4.1.1. Aerosol Chemical Properties
The diurnal variations in D50at different SS, the mass fraction of m/z44 in organic mass
spectrum ( f44), aerosol chemical composition, and PNSD are given in Figure 3. The sources
and properties of aerosol particles vary with different size ranges, leading to a diverse
diurnal variation in D50at different SS (Figure 3a–c). As a typical tracer for SOA formation,
thef44 can be associated with OA hygroscopicity owing to their positive correlations
reported in previous studies [ 54,55]. Both f44 and the sum fraction of hygroscopic inorganic
components (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium) had a noticeable peak in the afternoon
(Figure 3d,e), implying they were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by photochemical oxidation
in the daytime. Meanwhile, the minimum of D50for all three SS conditions occurred
around 15:00, corresponding to the diurnal peak time of f44 and the fraction of inorganic
components. This suggests photochemical reactions on daily basis played an important
role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity.

Figure 3. Diurnal variations in ( a–c) critical activation diameters ( D50) at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, 
respectively; ( d) the mass fraction of m/z 44 in organic mass spectrum ( f44); ( e) aerosol chemical

show the 25th and 75th and whiskers sh ow the 10th and 90th percentiles. 
Note that the diurnal cycles of  D50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3% exhibited a remarkable max-
imum around 18:00, with additional peaks occurring at 7:00 and 12:00. In contrast, no 
prominent diurnal peak occurred in the diurnal cycle of D50 at SS = 0.1%. Tra ﬃc and cook-
ing emissions are the main sources of primary OA (POA) in Beijing, and these fresh emis-sions could lead to a decrease in f44 [56,57]. Therefore, the reduction time in the f44 diurnal 
cycle matched to the periods of daily source emissions, such as morning and evening traf-
ﬁc peaks, as well as lunch and dinner times.  Consequently, the hydrophobic POA was not 
favor for CCN activation, leading to an increase in D
50 at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. In addition, 
the diurnal variation in aeroso l number concentration within the size range of 60–150 nm 
was consistent with that of D50 (SS = 0.2% and 0.3%) (Figure 3f ), indicating that particles 
within this size range were signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced by tra ﬃc and cooking emissions. For 
particles larger than 150 nm, their nu mber concentration showed no signi ﬁcant changes 
during the periods of concentrated emissions, suggesting that local primary emissions had 
few in ﬂuences on particle properties with this si ze range. Therefore, there were no signif-
icant peaks observed in the diurnal variation in  D 50 at SS = 0.1%, which was generally 
larger than 150 nm during this campaign (Figure 3a). 
The mean value of PM 2.5 mass concentration during this campaign is 25 µg m−3. Once 
the PM 2.5 mass concentration exceeded this mean value, a period of pollution accumula-
tion typically occurred for one to several days. Therefore, in order to further illustrate the 
impacts of aerosol chemical composition on CCN activity at the di ﬀerent pollution levels, 
we de ﬁned the PM 2.5 mass concentrations ≤25 µg m−3 and >25 µg m−3 as clean and polluted 
conditions, respectively. Note that the bulk aerosol composition measured by the ASCM is sensitive to larger particles, which contri bute the majority of the total mass. Thus, the 
bulk composition tends to mainly re ﬂect the composition information for larger particles. 
Here, only the relationships between the fraction of each chemical component and D
50 at 
SS = 0.1% are presented in Figure 4. Under the polluted conditions, the fraction of nitrate 
increased with PM 2.5 concentrations and exhibited a negative correlation with D50 (r = 
−0.68), but no correlation between them ( r = 0.02) under the clean conditions. In contrast, 
the fraction of sulfate only showed a correlation with D50 under the clean conditions ( r = 
−0.47). These relationships indicated that as the concentration of PM 2.5 increases, the dom-
inant driver of CCN activity transitioned from  sulfate to nitrate. Compared with the sec-
ondary inorganic components, both the fracti ons of organics and BC showed a positive 
correlation with D50 due to their limited hygroscopicity. 210

Note that the diurnal cycles of D50at SS = 0.2% and 0.3% exhibited a remarkable
maximum around 18:00, with additional peaks occurring at 7:00 and 12:00. In contrast,
no prominent diurnal peak occurred in the diurnal cycle of D50at SS = 0.1%. Trafﬁc and

0.3%. In addition, the diurnal variation in aerosol number concentration within the size
range of 60–150 nm was consistent with that of D50(SS = 0.2% and 0.3%) (Figure 3f),
indicating that particles within this size range were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by trafﬁc and
cooking emissions. For particles larger than 150 nm, their number concentration showed
no signiﬁcant changes during the periods of concentrated emissions, suggesting that local
primary emissions had few inﬂuences on particle properties with this size range. Therefore,
there were no signiﬁcant peaks observed in the diurnal variation in D50at SS = 0.1%, which
was generally larger than 150 nm during this campaign (Figure 3a).
The mean value of PM 2.5mass concentration during this campaign is 25 µg m−3. Once
the PM 2.5mass concentration exceeded this mean value, a period of pollution accumu-
lation typically occurred for one to several days. Therefore, in order to further illustrate
the impacts of aerosol chemical composition on CCN activity at the different pollution
levels, we deﬁned the PM 2.5mass concentrations ≤25µg m−3and >25 µg m−3as clean
and polluted conditions, respectively. Note that the bulk aerosol composition measured by
the ASCM is sensitive to larger particles, which contribute the majority of the total mass.
Thus, the bulk composition tends to mainly reﬂect the composition information for larger
particles. Here, only the relationships between the fraction of each chemical component
andD50at SS = 0.1% are presented in Figure 4. Under the polluted conditions, the fraction
of nitrate increased with PM 2.5concentrations and exhibited a negative correlation with D50
(r=−0.68), but no correlation between them ( r= 0.02) under the clean conditions. In con-
trast, the fraction of sulfate only showed a correlation with D50under the clean conditions
(r=−0.47). These relationships indicated that as the concentration of PM 2.5increases, the
dominant driver of CCN activity transitioned from sulfate to nitrate. Compared with the

4.1.2. Mixing State and Its Impacts on CCN Activity 
As introduced in Section 2.3.1, the ratio of ( D75 − D25)/D50 can be used to describe the 
external-mixing degree of aerosol components. The relationships between ( D75 − D25)/D50 
and D50 under di ﬀerent SS conditions are shown in Figure 5. Jurányi et al. (2013) pointed 
out that the ( D75 − D25)/D50 varied from 0.08 to 0.12 for ammonium sulfate calibration meas-
urements at SS = 0.1–1.0%, which indicated an internal mixture within measurement ac-curacy [46]. For our measurements, the value of ( D
75 − D25)/D50 distributed in a range of 
0.14–0.59, with a median value of 0.31, 0.31, and 0.33 at SS = 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%, respec-
tively. The higher ( D75 − D25)/D50 at SS = 0.3% suggested the smaller particles ( Dp < 100nm) 
tended to be more external mixing. The ( D75 − D25)/D50 in this study is signi ﬁcantly higher 
than that in a rural background site [31], where the ( D75 − D25)/D50 ranged from 0.15 to 0.20 
at SS = 0.1 to 0.7%. Compared with the rura l background site, aerosol particles in urban 
Beijing represent a more complex mixture originating from local anthropogenic emissions 
and regional transport. 100

external-mixing degree of aerosol components. The relationships between ( D75−D25)/D50
andD50under different SS conditions are shown in Figure 5. Jur ányi et al. (2013) pointed
out that the ( D75−D25)/D50varied from 0.08 to 0.12 for ammonium sulfate calibration

accuracy [ 46]. For our measurements, the value of ( D75−D25)/D50distributed in a range

spectively. The solid circle, error bars denote th e median, 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. 
For a speci ﬁc SS, D50 decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing, im-
plying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity. Particularly, the variation in the mixing stat e exhibits high sensitivity to D
50 when the ratio drops from 
0.5 to 0.3. This can be a ttributed to the increases in the internal mixing level during the 
aerosol aging process, leading to an enhanc ement in aerosol chemical homogeneity and 
hygroscopicity. The relationship between ( D75 − D25)/D50 and D50 can be well ﬁtted with an 
exponential function under the conditions of  SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. However, under the 
condition of SS = 0.1%, their relationship is hard to be adequately ﬁtted. Further analysis 
of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of ( D75 − D25)/D50 
(0.3–0.4) with small D50 (<165 nm) occurred under high PM 2.5 concentration (>60 µg m−3) 
and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship deviated from sat-
isfactory ﬁtting by using an exponential function. Under these conditions, the hygrosco-
picity and size of aerosol particles were enlarg ed due to the increasing fraction of nitrate 
and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period, the droplets had a 
more diverse population of κ values, as separated by some of them already condensing 
droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being dried, these en-
larged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or droplets) 
from a wider size range with various κ values, thereby exhibiting a special kind of chem-
ical inhomogeneity. 
4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity 
The size-resolved κ
ccn can be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by us-
ing the D50 at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the κccn and Dp at var-
ious environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites. As 
can be seen, κccn exhibited a positive correlation with Dp at most of those sites except for 
mountain site, which had a higher κccn for the smaller particles. In these results, κccn rapidly 
increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas κccn almost stays con-
stant at  Dp of 100 to 200 nm. This is consistent with previously reported results on the size-
resolved aerosol chemical compositions [27], which presented a substantially varying 
composition within small particle size range an d relatively stable compositions for larger 
particles. In addition, the κccn observed at urban sites were signi ﬁcantly lower than that at 
rural sites, which can be a ttributed to the enhanced aerosol aging state from urban to rural 0.6

respectively. The solid circle, error bars denote the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively.
For a speciﬁc SS, D50decreased with an increase in the degree of internal mixing,
implying that enhancing the internal mixing level facilitated the CCN activity. Particularly,
the variation in the mixing state exhibits high sensitivity to D50when the ratio drops
from 0.5 to 0.3. This can be attributed to the increases in the internal mixing level during
the aerosol aging process, leading to an enhancement in aerosol chemical homogeneity
and hygroscopicity. The relationship between ( D75−D25)/D50and D50can be well ﬁt-
ted with an exponential function under the conditions of SS = 0.2% and 0.3%. However,
under the condition of SS = 0.1%, their relationship is hard to be adequately ﬁtted. Fur-
ther analysis of the relationship (SS = 0.1%) revealed that the relatively high values of
(D75−D25)/D50(0.3–0.4) with small D50(<165 nm) occurred under high PM 2.5concentra-
tion (>60 µg m−3) and high RH (>60%) conditions (Figure S2), leading to the relationship
deviated from satisfactory ﬁtting by using an exponential function. Under these condi-
tions, the hygroscopicity and size of aerosol particles were enlarged due to the increasing
fraction of nitrate and hygroscopic growth, respectively. Especially for the fog period,
the droplets had a more diverse population of κvalues, as separated by some of them
already condensing droplets. However, after passing through the sampling line and being
dried, these enlarged particles experienced a reduction in liquid water content and particle
size. As a result, the measured dry particles represent a mixture of ambient particles (or
droplets) from a wider size range with various κvalues, thereby exhibiting a special kind
of chemical inhomogeneity.
4.2. Estimating Organic Aerosol Hygroscopicity
The size-resolved κccncan be derived from size-resolved CCN measurements by using
theD50at various SS. Figure 6 shows the relationships between the κccnandDpat various
environmental sites in China, including urban, rural, coast, and mountain sites. As can
be seen, κccnexhibited a positive correlation with Dpat most of those sites except for
mountain site, which had a higher κccnfor the smaller particles. In these results, κccn
rapidly increased with particle size at the range of ~40 to 100 nm, whereas κccnalmost stays
constant at Dpof 100 to 200 nm. This is consistent with previously reported results on the
size-resolved aerosol chemical compositions [ 27], which presented a substantially varying
composition within small particle size range and relatively stable compositions for larger
particles. In addition, the κccnobserved at urban sites were signiﬁcantly lower than that at

As the ACSM is sensitive to particle mass rather than number concentration, the bulk 
composition is dominated by the contribution  of the larger particles. Therefore, a be tter 
correlation between κchem and κccn was exhibited at SS of 0.1% compared with the other 
two SS conditions (Figures 7a and S3), suggesting the κccn measured at SS = 0.1% was more 
suitable for closure analysis with κchem derived from bulk composition. Here, we assume 
the discrepancy between κchem and κccn was mainly induced by the utilization of constant 
OA hygroscopicity parameter ( κorg). Then, the κorg can be derived by subtracting the con-
tribution of the inorganic salts ( κinorg) from the κccn at SS = 0.1%, expressed as:

Duplissy et al. (2011) pointed out that the uncertainty in the estimation of κorg de-
creases with increasing organic fraction; ther eby, only data featuring organic fractions 
larger than 50% were used in this calculation [17].

As the ACSM is sensitive to particle mass rather than number concentration, the bulk 
composition is dominated by the contribution  of the larger particles. Therefore, a be tter 
correlation between κchem and κccn was exhibited at SS of 0.1% compared with the other 
two SS conditions (Figures 7a and S3), suggesting the κccn measured at SS = 0.1% was more 
suitable for closure analysis with κchem derived from bulk composition. Here, we assume 
the discrepancy between κchem and κccn was mainly induced by the utilization of constant 
OA hygroscopicity parameter ( κorg). Then, the κorg can be derived by subtracting the con-
tribution of the inorganic salts ( κinorg) from the κccn at SS = 0.1%, expressed as: 
𝜅୭୰୥=𝜅ୡୡ୬−( 𝜅 ୧୬୭୰୥ 𝜀୧୬୭୰୥ +𝜅 ୆େ𝜀୆େ)

larger than 50% were used in this calculation [17].

Duplissy et al. (2011) pointed out that the uncertainty in the estimation of κorgde-
creases with increasing organic fraction; thereby, only data featuring organic fractions
larger than 50% were used in this calculation [17].
As is shown in Figure 7b, the κorgshows a positive relationship with the concentration
ratio of organics to BC (Org/BC), which can be used to reﬂect the contribution of SOA
to total OA [ 60,61]. Several previous studies suggested κorgas a function of the f44 or
O:C [54,55] ; however, κorgwas not correlated to the f44 during the observation periods of
this study. This is similar to a recent study conducted by Kuang et al. (2021), which pointed
out that κorgwas weakly correlated with O:C, but well correlated with the sum mass fraction
of aged biomass burning OA and more oxygenated OA in total OA [ 23]. In order to parame-
terize the relationship between κorgand Org/BC ratios, κorgvalues were binned by Org/BC
in increments of 5. Then, a power ﬁtting function κorg= 0.05×(Org/BC)0.42was obtained.
This ﬁtting function was adopted to reconstruct the hygroscopicity parameter ( κchem_new ).
As is shown in Figure 7a, a better correlation between κchem andκccnwas achieved after
using the parameterized κorginstead of constant value (0.1), indicating suitable κorgscheme
play an important role in deriving κchem from aerosol chemical composition.
5. Conclusions
The in situ measurements of CCN activity at ground level can be applied to opti-
mize the parameters of retrieving cloud microphysics with remote sensing data. Notable
reductions in PM 2.5concentration over the past decade have been accompanied by sig-
niﬁcant changes in its chemical composition in the North China Plain. Therefore, more
investigations are needed to further understand the impacts of these variations on CCN
activity. In this study, aerosol size distribution, chemical composition, and CCN number
concentration were measured concurrently to investigate the size-resolved CCN activity
during wintertime 2022 in Beijing, China. The critical activation dimeter D50derived from
size-resolved activation ratio can be negatively associated with CCN activity. During the
observation period, the average CCN concentrations at SS = 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% were
1340 cm−3, 2750 cm−3, and 3270 cm−3, corresponding to the average D50of 172 nm, 102 nm,
and 84 nm, respectively. The impacts of aerosol size distribution, chemical composition,
and mixing state on CCN activity were investigated. The results show that photochemical
oxidation on a daily basis played an important role in enhancing aerosol hygroscopicity
and CCN activity. Conversely, the local emissions (such as trafﬁc and cooking) signiﬁcantly
enhanced D50at SS = 0.2% and 0.3%, but had few inﬂuences on D50at SS = 0.1% due to
the limitations of particle size from emission sources. As PM 2.5concentration increases,
the dominant driver of CCN activity transitions from sulfate to nitrate. For carbonaceous
components, both the fractions of organics and BC showed a positive correlation with D50
due to their weak hygroscopicity. The mixing state of particles was also estimated based
on the size-resolved AR curve ﬁtting. At a speciﬁc SS, D50decreased with increasing the
degree of internal mixing, implying that the elevated internal-mixing degree resulting from
atmospheric aging facilitated to the enhancement of CCN activity.
Aerosol hygroscopicity parameter κccnderived from the SMCA method was size-
dependent, varying from 0.26 to 0.34 as Dpincreased from 84 to 172 nm. Based on the bulk
aerosol chemical composition measured by the ACSM, the κchem values were calculated
using the ZSR method. The OA hygroscopicity κorgwas estimated by the closure analysis
between κchem andκccn. However, the commonly used f44 (or O:C) was weakly correlated
with κorgand failed to describe the variations in κorgduring the observation periods of
this study. Instead, the variations in κorgcan be well parameterized using the Org/BC
ratio, which is usually used as a tracer for the contribution of SOA to total OA. The
parameterization of κorgsubstantially improved the correlation between κchem andκccn,
emphasizing the importance of considering κorgvariations when deriving κchem from
aerosol chemical composition.
