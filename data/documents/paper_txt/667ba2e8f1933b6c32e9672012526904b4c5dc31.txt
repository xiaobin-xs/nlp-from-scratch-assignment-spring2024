Abstract
Many recent improvements in NLP stem
from the development and use of large pre-
trained language models (PLMs) with bil-
lionsofparameters. Largemodelsizesmakes
computational cost one of the main limiting
factors for training and evaluating such mod-
els; and has raised severe concerns about
the sustainability, reproducibility, and inclu-
siveness for researching PLMs. These con-
cernsareoftenbasedonpersonalexperiences
and observations. However, there had not
been any large-scale surveys that investigate
them. In this work, we provide a first at-
tempt to quantify these concerns regarding
threetopics,namely, environmentalimpact ,
equity, andimpact on peer reviewing . By
conducting a survey with 312 participants
from theNLP community, wecapture exist-
ing(dis)paritiesbetweendifferentandwithin
groups with respect to seniority, academia,
andindustry; andtheirimpacton thepeerre-
viewing process. For each topic, we provide
ananalysisanddeviserecommendationsto
mitigate found disparities, some of which al-
ready successfully implemented. Finally, we
discussadditionalconcernsraisedbymany
participants in free-text responses.

•Overall, ∼62%ofourrespondentshaveaccess
to less than eight GPUs and moreover, over
90%haveaccessto lessthan 10%of thetotal

recent work (Izsak et al., 2021) showed that
a clever set of techniques can be used to train

ing artifacts (such as code, models, training

•The group that suffers most from lack of re-
sources are students, who struggle to repro-

our survey responses that “industry” has ac-

“academia”. Instead, this mostly seems to be
the case for very few extreme outliers (6%).

community and for devising concrete actions to
make research more inclusive.
2 Survey Description
The survey was open over a period of 17 days,
fromMonday,July12,2021toThursday,July29,
2021. It was conducted via Microsoft Forms and
distributed across the *CL community by mass
mailingtoACLmembership,andsharedonTwitter.
During that time, we collected 312 responses. The
creation of the survey indicated that, “input willremainanonymousandtheresponseswillalsobe
summarized in aggregate form”.1Therefore the
data will be made available on request with a state-
ment of intended purpose, due to privacy and ethi-
cal restrictions.
2.1 Questionnaire
The questions were divided into four categories.
First, we collected some general information about
ourparticipants, liketheircurrentpositionand se-
niority (§2.2). Second, we asked our participants
abouttheirconcernsregardingtheenvironmental
impact of NLP experiments (§3) and their access
to computational resources (§4). Finally, we asked
abouttheimpactofcompute-intensiveexperiments
onthereviewingprocessaswellasaboutspecific
measurements to alleviate them (§5).
To keep a low-effort for our participants,
we crafted most of the ( 𝑄)uestions as simple
yes/no/unsurequestions. Forsubjectsthatrequire
a more fine-grained analysis (e.g., environmental
concerns)weusedfivepointscales(eithernumeric
ortext-based). Overall,weaskedatotalof19ques-
tionsfromwhich15weremultiple-choicequestions
(13 with a single answer possibility and two with
multiple possible answers). 𝑄4 (available compute
resources) and 𝑄11 (number of times reviewers
asked for expensive experiments) required a nu-
meric answer. Finally, 𝑄9,𝑄18, and𝑄19 allowed
free text answers. Participants were asked to pro-
vide answers to 13 questions, while six questions
(𝑄4,𝑄9,𝑄11,𝑄12,𝑄14,𝑄19)wereoptional. All
questions are provided in Table 1.
2.2 Demographic Overview
In our first three questions, we asked the partic-
ipants about their seniority, job sector, and geo-
graphic location (Fig. 2).
Seniority. We asked our participants about the
numberofactiveyearsinthe*CLcommunityasan
author, reviewer, or in a related role ( 𝑄1). Overall,
a little over half (53.5%) indicated they were junior
members of the community, while the remainder
were fairly evenly split across mid- and late-career.
Job Sector. We further asked our participants
about the current position they are holding ( 𝑄2).

terms of geographic location limits the expressive-
ness ofthis factor andthus, will notbe considered
for our analysis.
2.3 Methodology
In the following sections, we analyse and discuss
the participants’ responses with respect to the re-
maining three categories ( environmental concerns ,
equity,andimpactonthereviewingprocess ). For
each section, we first provide an overview of the
distributionintheresponsesandthenprovideafine-
grained analysis with respect to the seniority and
job sector . The goal of the fine-grained analysis
istoinvestigateifwecanobserveanystatistically
significant differences across different groups.
Statistical tests. Due to the explorative nature of
oursurvey,thecollecteddataviolatesthenecessary
conditionsonhomoscedasticity(Levene,1960)and
normality (Shaphiro and Wilk, 1965) that are re-
quiredtoconductananalysisofvariances(ANOVA,
Fisher1921). Instead,weperformaKruskal-Wallis
test (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952) as an indicator
for any statistically significant differences2and if
so, perform pairwise Welch’s t-tests (Welch, 1951)
against a Bonferroni corrected 𝛼=0.05

(notmergingacademiaandindustrysectors). For
the numerical questions ( 𝑄4 and𝑄11), we further
analyze if there exist disparities within each group,
using interquartile ranges with 𝑘= 1.5to detect
outliers (Tukey, 1977).
3 Environmental Footprint
We quantified existing concerns about the environ-
mental impact of NLP experiments using a five
pointLikert scale( 𝑄7)and askedourparticipants
toselectthemostpressingissueinthetypicallife
cycle of an NLP model ( 𝑄8) between (Train)ing,
model (Select)tion, and (Infer)ence. Participants
wereallowedtoselect allapplicableanswersand
could select (None) or provide (Other) pressing is-
sues. Theycouldalsoprovideatextualjustification
of their answer(s) ( 𝑄9).
3.1 Analysis
Figure 3a shows that more than 50% of our partici-
pantsweremoderately(28.2%)orvery(27.9%)con-
cernedabouttheenvironmentalfootprintofNLP,
while around 33% of them were slightly (14.7%)
or somewhat (18.6%) concerned. 10.6% of par-
ticipants were not concerned at all. Our partic-
ipants further agreed that training(75.3%) and
model selection (59.9%) are the most pressing is-
sues (Fig. 3b).3Inference took third place with
20.2%,while6.1%ofourparticipantsselected none.
Thesmallestnumberresponseswasgivenfor other

tionseach)beingthemostfrequentones. Alsomen-
tionedwere storageconsumption ,hardware ,expec-
tationsaboutlargedataexperiments ,andscale. In-
terestingly, many respondents considered inference
less pressing than training and model selection.
Job Sector. Although wedo not findsignificant
differences by seniority, we see larger (although
notstatisticallysignificant)differences whenlook-
ing at the responses grouped by researchers from
different job sectors (Fig. 4a). We find that respon-
dents from the large industry sector were mostly
somewhat concerned,whilethemedianforallother
groupsliesat oftenconcerned. Similarly,wealso
see larger differences in the most pressing issues

large industries were substantially more concerned
with respect toinference and muchless concerned
with respect to model selection than academia.
3.2 Discussion and Recommendations
Ananalysisofthe81(26%)free-textresponses( 𝑄9)
reveals diverse opinions about the environmental
impact of NLP and the reasons behind the most
pressingfactors. Forinstance,amongrespondents
thatstatedtobe notatall concernedaboutNLP’s
environmental footprint, a majority considered the
impact of NLP research on climate change to be
negligible compared to other factors. Factors men-
tioned as being more relevant to climate change
include air travel (also mentioned twice in the gen-
eral responses 𝑄19), cars, and more cost intensive
computations from other areas (of science). An-
other argument brought up multiple times in this
groupofrespondentsisthattheACLisnottheright
institution to tackle challenges of climate change.
Some responses alternatively suggested to push for
regulatorychanges,sincebigtechcompaniesmight
not be affected by decisions made by the ACL.
Regardingthemostpressingfactors,oneofthe
main arguments provided for inference was that in-
dustry spends most time on inference, hence it is
themostexpensiveone. However,participantsalso
arguedthatthereexistvariousmethodsforefficient
inference(see,e.g.,Trevisoetal.,2023). Prominent
argumentswithrespecttotrainingandmodelselec-
tionwerethatthepressuretoachievestate-of-the-
art performance leads to extensive hyperparameter
tuning and that a large variety of models are being
trained during research and development (even if
just for debugging) without being ever deployed.4 Equity
The(in)equityoftheavailablecomputeresources
across groups (e.g., academia and industry) is an
increasinglybroughtuptopicindiscussions. While
thegeneralgistseemstobethatmanyresearchers
feelexcluded bynot havingaccess tosubstantially
large compute power (e.g., thousands of GPUs),
it often remains unclear whether this is really the
case. Oneofthemainobjectivesofthissurveywas
therefore to quantify such potential disparities.
4.1 Analysis
For𝑄4,229participantsresponded(73.4%)with
the number of GPUs they have access to. Fig. 1
showsthedistributionofthetotalnumberofGPUs
across our participants (in %). Overall, we observe
a high disparity across our participants in terms of
access to GPUs. For instance, 62% of the partici-
pants had access to less than eight GPUs(Fig. 6a),
thenumberusedfortrainingacademicBERT(Izsak
etal.,2021),and87.8%oftheparticipantshadac-
cess to only 9.7% of the total number of GPUs.
15 participants (6.6%) had access to more than 100
GPUs, up to 3000 GPUs, representing 85.6% of
thetotalGPU count( ∼11.2k). An outlieranalysis
shows that 13.1% of the respondents had access
to a substantially higher number of GPUs (more
than 22 GPUs) than the rest. We further find that
57.4% of our participants were unable to run exper-
iments dueto the lackof computational resources,
and36.2%hadnolackofresources( 𝑄5). Finally,

estnumberofavailableGPUs,thedifferencesseem
less substantial compared to researchers at small
industry (p-value = 0.110). Additionally, we find
that large industry has the highest percentage of
outliers and the largest in-group disparity. Interest-
ingly,researchersfromsmallindustryseemtohave
the least issues when running experiments; a stark
contrast considering they are among those who re-
ported the fewest GPU resources ( 𝑄5). Regard-
ing𝑄6, researchers from large industry responded
slightly less often than other groups that their re-

4.2 Discussion and Recommendations
While our survey highlights existing disparities,
particularly between small industry or academic
researchers and large industry, we also find that
thereexistsubstantialdisparities withineachgroup.
Most surprising might be the general disparity
we find across the field, as 87.8% of our partici-
pants had access to less than 10% of the total num-
ber of GPUs, and 62% had access to less then 8
GPUs. Only a very small faction of researchers
(2.2% of our respondents) had access to GPU com-
pute (1000 or more) to train models with several
hundredsofbillionparametersforseveraldaysor
weeks. Many researchers, hence, could only fine-
tune models—which requires far fewer resources
thanpre-training(Zhouetal.,2021)—whichisonly
possible when pre-trained model weights are avail-
able. Unfortunately, many recent models are being
kept private, which has intensified the discussion
about equity in the field (Togelius and Yannakakis,
2023).
5 Impact on Reviewing
Finally,wequantifiedhowtheconcernsaboutthe
environmentalimpactanddifferencesintermsof
availablecomputeresourcesaffectpeerreviewing
(𝑄10–𝑄13). Wefurtheraskedourparticipantsfour
questions(𝑄14–𝑄17)whichrelatetoconcreteideas
that would change the reviewing process and en-
courage model release ( 𝑄18).

With respect to the concrete reviewing actions,
Fig.9ashowsthatalargemajority(89.8%)ofour
participantswouldconsidersubmittingtheirwork
to a dedicated track on efficient methods ( 𝑄14).
Followingupontheresultsfromthesurvey,such
an efficiency track was implemented at EMNLP
2022. 35.9% of our participants were unsure about
requestingauthorstojustifytheallocationofbud-
get for experiments ( 𝑄15), with 41% voting for
yes. Also, even though 52.6% of the participants
had not been asked for experiments that were too
expensiveforthem,aclearmajorityofthepartic-
ipants (83.7%) would like to require reviewers to
justifytheirpetitionsformoreexperiments( 𝑄16).
Lastly,wealsoseealargemajority(75.6%)thatbe-
lievedthattheirworkcouldbenefitfromtherelease
of small versions of pretrained models alongside
large ones (𝑄17). To promote this, a majority of
our respondents thought that venues should have
a visible branding of papers to release a model
(59.3%) and that reviewers should be instructed to
reward model release (50.6%). 42.6% of respon-
dents thought that the venues should grant a best
artifactaward. 11.5% of respondents supported
noneof the options. A first step towards increasing
the reproducibility and ensuring the submission of
experimental code was implemented at NAACL

Seniority. We find no significant differences
w.r.t. the seniority of our participants regarding

showed a substantially higher tendency towards
requesting authors to justify their compute bud-
get (𝑄15) against all other age groups (p-values

5.2 Discussion and Recommendations
Our analysis shows that the two most pressing is-
sues among our respondents are the lack of re-
sources to reproduce results and reviewers request-
ingfortooexpensiveexperimentswithoutproper
justification. Thisisreflectedinthelargesupport
for both respective counter measures; namely, ask-
ingreviewerstoprovidejustificationandtherelease

struct reviewers to consider the compute budget

ments.7
Among the 22 additional suggestions for 𝑄18,
we find a high emphasis (68.2%) towards the re-
leaseofartifacts—bothbecausethisfacilitatesfu-
tureresearchandhelpsreproducibility. Moreover,
22ofthe67generalsuggestion( 𝑄19)alsotouched
upon issues about model release and reviewing,
highlighting the importance of both topics. The
responses mentioned a remarkably wide variety of
artifacts: code;trainedmodels;systemoutputs(to
facilitate comparative evaluations without rerun-
ning the code); training checkpoints (to study the
trainingdynamics);andproperdocumentationof
trainingdata(includingcrowdsourcingquestions).
In addition to simply releasing trained models, sev-
eral respondents also wished for a sufficiently high
quality of the released models complemented by
code and documentation. One particular concern
washowthereleaseofartifactsshouldbeintegrated
into the reviewing process. On the one hand, it
seemsusefultosubmitartifactstogetherwiththe
paper before reviewing, so that reviewers can ac-
cessthemandtopreventbreakingpromisesoffu-
ture code release. On the other hand, this needs
to happen within the constraints of double-blind

𝑄18and𝑄19suggestedthatartifactreleaseshould
be mandatory for acceptance.
6 Further Considerations
Finally,wediscusssuggestions( 𝑄19)thatdonotfit
intoanyofthepreviouslydiscussedtopics. From
the 67 free-text responses (21.5%), the two most
prominent topics were evaluation (11 respondents)
and emphasizing research over engineering (7 re-
spondents).
Evaluation. 16.4% of the free-text respondents
touched upon the issue of evaluation and model
comparability;ascurrentbenchmarksoftenfocus
on improving a single metric. One measure to
counterthistrendwouldbetoreportperformance
basedonParetofrontiersandtoconsiderthecom-
pute budget along with the model performance. To
promote such curves, it would also be important
to release metadata including preprocessing and
hyperparameter choices that allows future research
to draw proper comparisons as well as to provide
concrete guidelines for reviewers.

ilychasinghighperformance; strayingawayfrom

were to actively promote more theoretical, or more
non deep learning work.
Other suggestions. Another suggestion worth
mentioningwasthecreationofaseparatetrack(four

orforindustrythatcannotpublishtheirmodels. Fi-
nally, there was also a call for more shared tasks
with limited resources such as the efficient NMT
challenge (Heafield et al., 2022) or the efficient in-
ference task (Moosavi et al., 2020).

found a high disparity among our respondents with
students and small industry researchers suffering
most from a lack of resources. There was a large

Considering the continuous increase of param-eters in PLMs (Zhao et al., 2023), one danger we

Limitations
To receive a large number of responses, this survey
wasadvertisedthroughoutvariouschannels. Hence,
thisisbynomeansarepresentativestudywithinthe
whole*CLcommunity. Thisispartiallyreflectedin
theevaluationofthegeographiclocations,e.g.,they
were too coarse to capture a more precise picture
about existing geographic inequalities. Nonethe-
less, the fact that we did not receive any responses
from bodies located in Africa indicates that there
