Purpose: To identify MRI features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that predict microvascular invasion (MVI) and postoperative 
intrahepatic recurrence in patients without peritumoral hepatobiliary phase (HBP) hypointensity.
Patients and Methods: One hundred and thirty patients with HCC who underwent preoperative gadoxetate-enhanced MRI and 
curative hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Two radiologists reviewed all preoperative MR images and assessed the 
radiological features of HCCs. The ability of peritumoral HBP hypointensity to identify MVI and intrahepatic recurrence was 
analyzed. We then assessed the MRI features of HCC that predicted the MVI and intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the 
subgroup without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Finally, a two-step flowchart was constructed to assist in clinical decision-making.
Results: Peritumoral HBP hypointensity (odds ratio, 3.019; 95% confidence interval: 1.071–8.512; P=0.037) was an independent 
predictor of MVI. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and AUROC of peritumoral HBP 
hypointensity in predicting MVI were 23.80%, 91.04%, 71.23%, 55.96%, and 0.574, respectively. Intrahepatic RFS was significantly 
shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity ( P<0.001). In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the only 
significant difference between MVI-positive and MVI-negative HCCs was the presence of a radiological capsule ( P=0.038). Satellite 
nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS (hazard ratio,3.324; 95% CI: 1.733–6.378; P<0.001). The high-risk HCC 
detection rate was significantly higher when using the two-step flowchart that incorporated peritumoral HBP hypointensity and satellite 
nodule than when using peritumoral HBP hypointensity alone ( P<0.001).
Conclusion: In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, a radiological capsule is useful for identifying MVI and satellite 
nodule is an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths worldwide, with a relative 5-year survival rate of approximately 18%.1,2 China has a high burden of liver cancer,

with 45.3% of liver cancer cases and 47.1% of liver cancer deaths globally.3 Radical resection is the main curative 
treatment for HCC. However, more than half of the patients treated with R0 resection will develop recurrence,4 which has 
a strong impact on prognosis. Microvascular invasion (MVI), defined as the presence of clusters of tumor cells in vessels 
located in the peritumoral area of the liver,5 is a major risk factor for HCC recurrence after surgery. However, MVI can 
only be detected by microscopic examination of the surgical specimen, which limits its application, particularly in terms 
of preoperative therapeutic decision-making and determination of resection margins during hepatectomy. Therefore, it is 
of great value to explore noninvasive methods that can determine MVI status preoperatively.
Several noninvasive preoperative methods, including radiomics, deep learning, and gene expression signatures, have 
been used to predict MVI status and early tumor recurrence. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic 
acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI is widely used for the diagnosis and assessment of HCC. Assessment of tumor 
features on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI is easy to perform and does not require additional devices or expenses. 
Owing to the lack of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporter expression, most HCCs present 
hypointense signal compared to the surrounding liver parenchyma on hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging. In MVI- 
positive patients, tumor cells in the vessels can result in dysfunction of the OATP transporter in hepatocytes located in the 
peritumoral liver parenchyma, leading to peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Although peritumoral HBP hypointensity has 
been identified as an important imaging feature with high specificity for predicting MVI, its sensitivity is relatively poor 
and was found to be only 44.2% in a recent meta-analysis.6,7 This finding indicates that more than half of patients with 
MVI do not show peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Given the importance of MVI in HCC management, it is imperative to 
identify complementary features that can predict MVI and tumor recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP 
hypointensity. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on this topic or its population.
Therefore, this study aimed to identify the MRI features of HCC that predict MVI and postoperative recurrence in 
patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity.
Materials and Methods
Patients
This retrospective study was compliant with the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and approved by 
the ethics committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. The requirement 
for written informed consent was waived by the Institutional Review Board owing to the retrospective observational 
nature of the study, and all patient data are treated confidentially. The data of treatment-naive patients who underwent 
preoperative liver Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and curative hepatic resection for HCC at our institution between 
December 2017 and December 2021 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria were age >18 years and presence of a single 
histopathologically confirmed HCC lesion. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) more than a 2-month 
interval between Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI and surgery, (2) suboptimal MRI quality, (3) pathologically confirmed 
macroscopic vascular invasion, (4) extrahepatic spread on preoperative work-up, (5) incomplete clinical and laboratory 
data, (6) lack of follow-up data, and (7) history of preoperative HCC-related treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
transarterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, or immunosuppressive therapy).
MRI Protocol
Patients underwent upper abdominal MRI using two 3.0-T MRI vectors with an 8-channel Atlas Speeder phased-array 
coil (Titan; Toshiba Medical Systems, Tochigi, Japan) or 18-channel phased-array coil (Prisma; Siemens Healthcare, 
Erlangen, Germany). All patients fasted for at least 8 h before MRI examination. Axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and 
dynamic contrast-enhanced images were obtained in all the cases. Each patient received 0.1 mL/kg of gadoxetic acid 
disodium (Primovist; Bayer Vital GmbH, Berlin, Germany) at a flow rate of 2 mL/s to acquire Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced 
images. Arterial phase, portal phase, and HBP images were obtained 15 s, 60–70 s, and 20 min after contrast injection, 
respectively. The acquisition parameters are listed in Table S1 .

Interpretation of Images
Two board-certified radiologists (X.H.L. and Y .M.Y., with 5 and 10 years of experience in liver MRI, respectively), who 
were blinded to the histopathological results, laboratory data, and follow-up information, independently reviewed all 
preoperative MRI scans. They were required to count the number, measure the longest diameter of each target 
observation, and classify the imaging features of each HCC lesion. Two weeks before the formal assessment, they 
were required to discuss the presentation of each MRI feature, and were trained in 20 cases. The definition of imaging 
features on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI has been described in other studies and is documented in Table S2 .8–10 The 
interobserver agreement was assessed after independent image review. In the event of disagreement between the two 
radiologists, a senior radiologist (Z.Y .C., with 15 years of experience in liver MRI) reviewed the images and discussed 
them with the other two radiologists, and a consensus was reached by a majority vote.
Clinical and Laboratory Data
Clinical (age, sex, etiology of chronic liver disease) and laboratory data (white blood cells [WBC], red blood cells 
[RBC], hemoglobin [HB], platelets [PLT], prothrombin time [PT], international normalized ratio of prothrombin [INR], 
activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT], fibrinogen [FIB], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase 
[AST], albumin [ALB], globulin [GLB], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gamma-glutamyltransferase [GGT], total bilirubin 
[TBIL], creatinine [Cr]), and serum alpha-fetoprotein [AFP]) within 1 week before hepatectomy were reviewed. The 
Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) stage and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score were calculated for each patient 
according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) guidelines.11
Histological Evaluation
After surgical resection, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and 
evaluated by a senior pathologist with 15 years of experience in liver pathology, according to the seven-point baseline 
sampling protocol. Histopathological reports included tumor number, tumor size, Edmondson grade, MVI status, and 
final diagnosis. MVI was defined as the presence of tumor cells in the endothelium-lined vascular lumen observed only 
by microscopy.
Follow-Up After Surgical Resection
All patients underwent clinical and radiological follow-up at 1 month after hepatectomy, at 3-month intervals for the first 
2 years, and at 6-month intervals for up to 5 years thereafter. Radiological follow-up consisted of ultrasonography, 
dynamic-enhanced computed tomography, or Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. When recurrence was suspected clinically 
or radiologically, appropriate management was implemented according to our institutional protocol and the AASLD 
guidelines. Patients were censored in the event of local recurrence, loss to follow-up, or on March 1, 2023, whichever 
event occurred first. Intrahepatic recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time interval between hepatectomy 
and intrahepatic recurrence.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were reported as the mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile range [IQR]) and were 
compared between groups using Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U-test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were 
reported as frequency (percentage) and compared between groups using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as 
appropriate. Interobserver agreement regarding MRI features was assessed using the Cohen’s kappa (κ) value and graded 
based on the Landis and Koch scale (0.00, poor agreement; 0.01–0.20, slight agreement; 0.21–0.40, fair agreement; 0.41– 
0.60, moderate agreement; 0.61–0.80, substantial agreement; and >0.80, nearly perfect agreement).12
The relationship between radiological variables and MVI status was assessed using univariate logistic regression 
analysis. Variables with a P-value <0.05 in univariate analysis were entered into multivariate logistic regression analysis 
with stepwise forward selection to identify independent risk factors. Prediction performance was assessed by measuring 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI),

sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Subgroup analysis was 
performed for patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, using the same methods.
Postoperative intrahepatic RFS was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and survival curves were compared 
using the Log rank test. The prognostic value of MRI features for postoperative intrahepatic RFS in the subgroup of 
patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards regression analyses and quantified using the hazard ratio (HR).
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 22.6; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY , USA) and MedCalc 
(version 16.8.4; Ostend, Belgium). Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided P-value <0.05.
Results
Patients
One hundred and thirty of 315 patients who underwent curative resection for HCC during the study period were enrolled 
(Figure 1 ). The median age was 55.0 years (IQR 47.0–63.0), 114 patients (87.7%) were male, the most common etiology 
of liver disease was chronic hepatitis B (84.6%), and 63 patients (48.5%) were MVI-positive. Edmondson grade III or IV 
was more common in the MVI-positive group than in the MVI-negative group. There were no other significant 
differences in the clinical or pathological characteristics between the two groups ( Table 1 ).

Interobserver Agreement Regarding MRI Features
The two radiologists showed moderate to excellent inter-observer agreement for the MRI features of HCC, with κ values 
in the range of 0.431–0.885 ( Table 2 ). The best interobserver agreement was observed for satellite nodule (κ=0.885; 95% 
CI: 0.796–0.974). Moderate consistency was observed for peritumoral HBP hypointensity (κ=0.511; 95% CI: 0.339– 
0.682).
MRI Features of HCC That Identify MVI Status
In univariate analysis, corona enhancement ( P=0.021) and peritumoral HBP hypointensity ( P=0.021) were more common 
in the MVI-positive group than in the MVI-negative group ( Table 3 ). In the multivariate analysis, corona enhancement Table 1 Clinical and Pathological Characteristics of MVI-Positive and MVI-Negative

MRI Features for Predicting Intrahepatic Recurrence
During a median follow-up period of 11 months (range, 1–56 months; IQR, 4–20 months), intrahepatic recurrence was 
diagnosed in 51 patients (39.3%). The median time to intrahepatic recurrence after curative hepatic resection was 7 
months (range, 1–47 months; IQR, 3–13 months). Kaplan–Meier curves showed that intrahepatic RFS was shorter in 
patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity than in those without ( Figure 3 , P<0.001). After adjusting potential 
confounders of age, gender, tumor size, and other radiological features, peritumoral HBP hypointensity (HR: 2.381, 
95% CI: 1.162–4.881, P=0.018) remained significantly associated with shorter intrahepatic RFS ( Table S4 ).Table 4 MRI Features of MVI-Negative and MVI-Positive HCCs in Subgroup Without Peritumoral HBP Hypointensity

In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, subgroup analysis showed that tumor size >5 cm ( P=0.001), non- 
smooth margins ( P=0.040), mosaic sign ( P=0.040), necrosis ( P=0.009), and satellite nodule ( P<0.001) were prognostic 
factors for intrahepatic RFS. However, only satellite nodule (HR: 3.324, 95% CI: 1.733–6.378, P<0.001) was identified 
as an independent prognostic factor for intrahepatic RFS in multivariate Cox regression analysis ( Table 5 ).
As shown in Figure 4 , intrahepatic RFS was similar in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity who had 
satellite nodule to that in patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity ( P=0.693). However, intrahepatic RFS was 
significantly shorter in both cohorts than that in patients without either of these MRI features ( P<0.001) (representative 
images: Figure 5 ).
T wo Stepwise Flowchart for Prediction of Intrahepatic Recurrence
To facilitate clinical use and improve performance, a two-step flowchart incorporating peritumoral HBP hypointensity 
and satellite nodule was developed to stratify intrahepatic recurrence risk ( Figure 6 ). Patients without peritumoral HBP 
hypointensity and satellite nodule had a low risk of intrahepatic recurrence, whereas those at a high risk (47/130, 36.2%) 
had an increased risk of intrahepatic recurrence. Using the two-step flowchart, 26 (20%) of 130 patients were reassigned

hypointensity alone ( P<0.001).
Discussion
The findings of this study confirm that peritumoral HBP hypointensity is an important MRI feature that can be used to 
preoperatively predict pathological MVI and shorter intrahepatic RFS and that the presence of a radiological capsule can 
help to predict MVI status in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. However, only the presence of satellite 
nodule was identified as an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS in this subgroup after univariate and multivariate 
Cox regression analyses.
Previous studies have established that the presence of MVI is one of the key factors in early recurrence of HCC and 
poor outcomes after curative liver resection or liver transplantation.13 Preoperative assessment of MVI is important for 
accurate selection of candidates for the various treatment options. For example, studies in which MVI status was

evaluated preoperatively found that the rate of early recurrence was lower after surgical resection than after radio -
frequency ablation and that anatomical resection was superior to nonanatomical resection.14–17 Therefore, the develop -
ment of noninvasive methods for preoperative prediction of MVI status has become an important research topic in recent 
years. The features of HCC observed on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were confirmed to be associated with MVI 
status. Our finding that corona enhancement and peritumoral HBP hypointensity are independent predictors of MVI is 
consistent with reports by Lee et al and Zhang et al15,18 For MVI-positive HCCs, local tumor invasion or infiltration of 
tumor cells into vessels could impair the function of peritumoral hepatocytes, which would result in impaired OATP 
transporter expression and decreased uptake of Gd-EOB-DTPA in the peritumoral region, that is, peritumoral HBP 
hypointensity.19 However, when infiltration of tumor cells in vessels is limited, impairment of OATP transporter function 
is also limited, as is the likelihood of peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Furthermore, HCCs with coactivation of Wnt/β- 
catenin signaling and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α could induce higher OATP expression and manifest as peritumoral 
HBP hyperenhancement.20 Therefore, peritumoral HBP hypointensity would be a good indicator for ruling in MVI rather 
than ruling it out. Our finding that the sensitivity of peritumoral HBP hypointensity in identifying MVI was quite low 
(23.80%) supports this theory. Almost three-quarters of the MVI-positive HCCs were missed when using this feature 
alone. Therefore, there is a need to explore other MRI features to identify MVI-positive HCC in patients without 
peritumoral HBP hypointensity.
The presence of a radiological capsule is a MRI characteristic that has been controversial in terms of predicting MVI 
status. Some studies have found that it is a valuable predictor of MVI-positive HCC, while others have not.21–24 
Interestingly, in our study, a radiological capsule could predict MVI in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, 
but not in the overall study cohort. A possible explanation for this finding is that peritumoral HBP hypointensity was 
significantly more common in patients with MVI-positive HCC than in MVI-negative HCC in those patients without 
a radiological capsule (50.0% vs 5.8%, P=0.015). After removal of patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity, there 
was a marked decrease in the proportion of patients with MVI-positive HCC without a radiological capsule. Therefore, 
the absence of a tumor capsule in this subgroup strongly indicates MVI-negative status and could be used as a rule-out

Recurrence-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with high-risk hepatocellular carcinoma than in those with low-risk hepatocellular carcinoma (hazard ratio

indicator. This is consistent with our finding that the presence of a radiological capsule has a relatively high NPV for 
predicting MVI-positive HCC in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity.
Peritumoral HBP hypointensity in HCC is not only associated with an increased risk of MVI but is also an established 
adverse prognostic imaging feature for early tumor recurrence after curative hepatic resection and liver 
transplantation.19,25 In our study, intrahepatic RFS was significantly shorter in patients with peritumoral HBP hypoin -
tensity than in patients without this feature. However, given the relatively low frequency of peritumoral HBP hypoin -
tensity, it is necessary to explore other supplementary MRI features that could predict postoperative recurrence. Our 
study demonstrated that satellite nodule was an independent risk factor for intrahepatic RFS in patients without 
peritumoral HBP hypointensity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the risk of tumor 
recurrence in patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. The effect of satellite nodule on tumor recurrence has been 
demonstrated in previous studies. Mulé et al found that satellite nodule was independently associated with both early and 
overall tumor recurrence.26 Similarly, Kim et al identified the presence of satellite nodule and peritumoral HBP 
hypointensity as independent factors associated with tumor recurrence after liver transplantation.27 These studies strongly 
support our findings. Moreover, intrahepatic RFS was comparable between patients with peritumoral HBP hypointensity 
and those with satellite nodule but without peritumoral HBP hypointensity. Therefore, we established a two-step 
flowchart based on MRI features for the prediction of early hepatic recurrence, which showed good performance in 
risk assessment.
Interobserver variability is a major concern in terms of the reliability of the features seen on preoperative MRI images 
when used as a decision-making tool. In our study, the two radiologists yielded moderate to excellent agreement 
(κ=0.431–0.885) for MRI features of HCC, which is similar to the results reported by Lee et al (κ 0.64–0.88).28 
However, Min et al and Kim et al reported relatively lower κ values (0.38–0.47 and 0.53–0.59, respectively).27,29 The 
good interobserver agreement in our study might be attributed to the discussion and case training on MRI features prior 
to formal assessment.
This study has several limitations. First, it had a single-center retrospective design and small sample size; therefore, 
there is a possibility of selection bias. Therefore, the results require confirmation in a larger multicenter prospective 
study. Second, the follow-up duration was relatively short and a proportion of patients were lost to follow-up, which may 
have diminished the strength of our results. However, most early intrahepatic HCCs occurred in the first year, similar to 
our data. Third, the main etiology of liver disease in our study was chronic hepatitis, particularly chronic hepatitis 
B. Further investigations in populations with different underlying causes are required.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we found peritumoral HBP hypointensity to be an important MRI feature for identifying MVI status and 
early intrahepatic recurrence but with low sensitivity. In patients without peritumoral HBP hypointensity, the presence of 
a radiological capsule may be useful for identifying the MVI status, whereas satellite nodule may be an independent risk 
factor for shorter intrahepatic RFS. The use of our two stepwise flowchart that incorporates peritumoral HBP hypoin -
tensity and satellite nodule could significantly improve the detection rate of high-risk HCC, which could assist clinicians 
in treatment decision-making.
