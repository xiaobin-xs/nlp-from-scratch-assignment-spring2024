ABSTRACT
Learning with reduced labeling standards, such as noisy label, partial label, and
multiple label candidates, which we generically refer to as imprecise labels, is
a commonplace challenge in machine learning tasks. Previous methods tend to
propose specific designs for every emerging imprecise label configuration, which is
usually unsustainable when multiple configurations of imprecision coexist. In this
paper, we introduce imprecise label learning (ILL), a framework for the unification
of learning with various imprecise label configurations. ILL leverages expectation-
maximization (EM) for modeling the imprecise label information, treating the
precise labels as latent variables. Instead of approximating the correct labels for
training, it considers the entire distribution of all possible labeling entailed by the
imprecise information. We demonstrate that ILL can seamlessly adapt to partial
label learning, semi-supervised learning, noisy label learning, and, more impor-
tantly, a mixture of these settings. Notably, ILL surpasses the existing specified
techniques for handling imprecise labels, marking the first unified framework with
robust and effective performance across various challenging settings. We hope our
work will inspire further research on this topic, unleashing the full potential of ILL
in wider scenarios where precise labels are expensive and complicated to obtain.
1 I NTRODUCTION
One of the critical challenges in machine learning is the collection of annotated data for model
training (He et al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Radford
et al., 2021). Ideally, every data instance would be fully annotated with precise labels. However,
collecting such data can be expensive, laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone. Often the labels
are just intrinsically difficult to ascertain precisely. Factors such as a lack of annotator expertise and
concerns related to privacy can also negatively affect the quality and completeness of the annotations.
In an attempt to circumvent this limitation, several methods have been proposed to permit model
learning from the data annotated with reduced labeling standards, which are generally easier to
obtain. We will refer to such labels as imprecise . Fig. 1 illustrates some typical mechanisms of label
imprecision that are commonly addressed in the literature. Label imprecision requires a modification
of the standard supervised training mechanism to build models for each specific case. For instance,
partial label learning (PLL) (Cour et al., 2011; Luo & Orabona, 2010; Feng et al., 2020b; Wang
et al., 2019a; Wen et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022a) allows instances to have a set
of candidate labels, instead of a single definitive one. Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) (Lee et al.,
2013; Samuli & Timo, 2017; Berthelot et al., 2019b;a; Sohn et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020b; Zhang
et al., 2021b; Wang et al., 2022c; 2023; Chen et al., 2023) seeks to enhance the generalization ability
when only a small set of labeled data is available, supplemented by a larger unlabeled set. Noisy label
learning (NLL) (Xiao et al., 2015a; Bekker & Goldberger, 2016; Goldberger & Ben-Reuven, 2016;
Ghosh et al., 2017; Han et al., 2018; Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Li et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019c;

Liu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2021d) deals with noisy scenarios
where the labels are corrupted or incorrect. There is a greater variety of other forms of imprecision,
including multiple (imprecise) annotations from crowd-sourcing (Ibrahim et al., 2023; Wei et al.,
2023), programmable weak supervision (Zhang et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023a), and bag-level weak
supervision (Ilse et al., 2018; Scott & Zhang, 2020; Garg et al., 2021), among others.
While prior arts have demonstrated success in handling individual configurations of label imprecision,
their approaches often differ substantially. They are tailored to a specific form of imprecision, as
depicted in Fig. 2. Such specificity not only imposes the necessity of devising a solution for emerging
types of label imprecision scenarios, but also complicates the deployment in practical settings, where
the annotations can be highly complex and may involve multiple coexisting imprecision configurations.
For instance, considering a scenario where both noisy labels and partial labels appear together, it
might be challenging to adapt previous methods in NLL or PLL to this scenario since they either rely
on the assumption of definite labels (Wei et al., 2023) or the existence of the correct label among
label candidates (Campagner, 2021), thus requiring additional algorithmic design. In fact, quite a
few recent works have attempted to address the combinations of imprecise labels in this way, such
as partial noisy label (Lian et al., 2022a; Xu et al., 2023) and semi-supervised partial label learning
(Wang et al., 2019b; Wang & Zhang, 2020). However, simply introducing a more sophisticated or
ad-hoc design can hardly scale to other settings. In addition, most of these approaches attempt to
infer the correct labels given the imprecise information ( e.g.through consistency with adjacent data
(Lee et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2020a), iterative refinement (Lv et al., 2020; Arachie & Huang, 2021),
average over the given labels (Hüllermeier & Cheng, 2015; Lv et al., 2023), etc.), to train the model,
which inevitably accumulates error during training, and reduces the generalization performance.
In this paper, we formulate the problem from a different view: rather than taking the imprecise label
information provided as a potentially noisy or incomplete attempt at assigning labels to instances, we
treat it generically as the information that imposes a deterministic or statistical restriction of the actual
applicable true labels. We then train the model over the distribution of all possible labeling entailed
by the given imprecise information. More specifically, for a dataset with samples Xand imprecise
label information I, we treat the inaccessible full and precise labels Yas a latent variable. The
model is then trained to maximize the likelihood of the provided information I. Since the likelihood
computed over the joint probability P(X, I;θ) =P
YP(X, I, Y ;θ)must marginalize out Y, the
actual information Iprovided could permit a potentially exponential number of labeling. To deal
with the resulting challenge of maximizing the logarithm of an expectation, we use the common
approach of expectation-maximization (EM) (Dempster et al., 1977), where the E-step computes
the expectation of P(X, I, Y ;θ)given the posterior of current belief P(Y|X, I;θt)and the M-step
maximizes the tight variational lower bound over P(X, I;θ). The overall framework is thus largely
agnostic to the various nature of label imprecision, with the imprecise label only affecting the manner
in which the posterior P(Y|X, I;θt)is computed. In fact, current approaches designed for various
imprecise label scenarios can be treated as specific instances of our framework. Thus, our approach
can serve as a solution towards a unified view for learning with anyimprecise labels.
While there exist earlier attempts on generalized or EM solutions for different (other) imprecise
supervisions or fuzzy observations (Denœux, 2011; Hüllermeier, 2014; Quost & Denoeux, 2016;
Van Rooyen & Williamson, 2017; Zhang et al., 2020), they usually require additional assumptions

and approximations on the imprecise information for learnablility (Campagner, 2021; 2023), thus
presenting limited scalability on practical settings (Quost & Denoeux, 2016). On the contrary, the
unified framework we propose subsumes all of these and naturally extends to the more practical
“mixed” style of data, where different types of imprecise labels coexist. Moreover, for noisy labels,
our framework inherently enables the learning of a noise model , as we will show in Section 3.2.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed imprecise label learning
(ILL) framework not only outperforms previous methods for dealing with single imprecise labels, but
also presents robustness and effectiveness for mixed label settings, leveraging the full potential to
more realistic and challenging scenarios. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We propose an EM framework towards the unification of learning from anyimprecise labels.
•We establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with the proposed method on partial label
learning, semi-supervised learning, and noisy label learning, demonstrating our method’s
robustness in more diverse, complex label noise scenarios.
•To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to show the robustness and effectiveness of a
single unified method for handling the mixture of various imprecise labels.
2 R ELATED WORK
We revisit the relevant work, especially the state-of-the-art popular baselines for learning with
individual imprecise label configurations. Let Xdenote the input space, and Y= [C] :={1, . . . , C }
represent the label space with Cdistinct labels. A fully annotated training dataset of size Nis
represented as D={(xi, yi)}i∈[N]. Learning with imprecise labels involves approximating the
mapping function f◦g:X → Y from a training dataset where the true label yis not fully revealed
from the annotation process. Here fis the backbone for feature extraction, grefers to the classifier
built on top of the features, and the output from f◦gis the predicted probability p(y|x;θ), where
θis the learnable parameter for f◦g. In this study, we primarily consider three imprecise label
configurations (as illustrated in Fig. 1) and their corresponding representative learning paradigms (as
shown in Fig. 2), namely partial label learning, semi-supervised learning, and noisy label learning. A
more comprehensive related work, including other forms of imprecision, is provided in Appendix B.
Partial label learning (PLL) . PLL aims to learn with a candidate label set s⊂ Y , where the
ground truth label y∈ Y is concealed in s. The training data for partial labels thus becomes
DPLL={(xi,si)}i∈[N]. The prior arts in PLL can be roughly divided into identification-based for
label disambiguation (Zhang & Yu, 2015; Gong et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2023b) or
average-based for utilizing all candidate labels equally (Hüllermeier & Beringer, 2006; Cour et al.,
2011; Lv et al., 2023). PiCO (Wang et al., 2022a) is a recent contrastive method that employs class
prototypes to enhance label disambiguation (as shown in Fig. 2(a)). It optimizes the cross-entropy
(CE)1loss between the prediction of the augmented training sample Aw(x)and the disambiguated
labels ˆs. The class prototypes are updated from the features associated with the same pseudo-targets.
A contrastive loss, based on MOCO (He et al., 2020), is employed to better learn the feature space,
drawing the projected and normalized features zwandzsof the two augmented versions of data
Aw(x)andAs(x)2closer. The overall objective of PiCO is formulated as follows:
LPiCO =LCE(p(y|Aw(x);θ),ˆs) +LCont(zw,zs,M). (1)
1For simplicity, we use LCEfor labels of the formats of class indices, one-hot vectors, and class probabilities.
2We use Awto indicate the weaker data augmentation and Asto indicate the stronger data augmentation.

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) . SSL is a paradigm for learning with a limited labeled dataset
supplemented by a much larger unlabeled dataset. We can define the labeled dataset as DL
SSL=
{(xl
i, yl
i)}i∈[NL], and the unlabeled dataset as DU={xu
j}j∈[NL+1,NL+NU], with NL≪NU.
SSL’s main challenge lies in effectively utilizing the unlabeled data to improve the generalization
performance. A general confidence-thresholding based self-training (Xie et al., 2020a; Sohn et al.,
2020) pipeline for SSL is shown in Fig. 2(b). Consider FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020) as an example;
there are usually two loss components: the supervised CE loss on labeled data and the unsupervised
CE loss on unlabeled data. For the unsupervised objective, the pseudo-labels ˆyufrom the network
itself are used to train on the unlabeled data. A “strong-weak” augmentation strategy (Xie et al.,
2020a) is commonly adopted. To ensure the quality of the pseudo-labels, only the pseudo-labels
whose confidence scores ˆpuare greater than a threshold τare selected to participate in training:
LFix=LCE 
p(y|Aw(xl);θ), yl
+ 1(ˆpu≥τ)LCE(p(y|As(xu);θ),ˆyu). (2)
Noisy label learning (NLL) . NLL aims at learning with a dataset of corrupted labels, DNLL=
{(xi,ˆyi)}i∈[N]. Overfitting to the noisy labels ˆycould result in poor generalization performance,
even if the training error is optimized towards zero (Zhang et al., 2016a; 2021c). Several strategies
to address the noisy labels have been proposed, such as robust loss functions (Ghosh et al., 2017;
Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Wang et al., 2019c) and noise estimation/correction techniques (Han et al.,
2018; Li et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021b; 2022). We illustrate the NLL pipeline (in
Fig. 2(c)) with the recent sparse over-parameterization (SOP) model (Liu et al., 2022), where a sparse
noise model consisting of parameters ui,vi∈[−1,1]Cfor each sample is adopted. The noise model
transforms the network prediction from the true label distribution into the noisy label distribution. A
CE loss and a mean-squared-error (MSE) loss optimize parameter {ui}and{vi}respectively:
LSOP=LCE(ϕ(p(y|Aw(x);θ) +m),ˆy) +LMSE(p(y|Aw(x);θ) +m,ˆy), (3)
where ϕdenotes the L∞normalization and mi=ui⊙ui⊙ˆyoh

regularization are additionally utilized for better performance in SOP (Liu et al., 2022).
Previous attempts to learn from imprecise labels. There are earlier attempts for the generalized
solutions of different kinds of imprecise labels/observations. Denœux (2011) proposed an EM
algorithm for the likelihood estimation of fuzzy data and verified the algorithm on linear regression
and uni-variate normal mixture estimation. Van Rooyen & Williamson (2017) developed an abstract
framework that generically tackles label corruption via the Markov transition. Quost & Denoeux
(2016) further extended the EM algorithm of fuzzy data on the finite mixture of Gaussians. While
relating to these works on the surface, ILL does not require any assumption on the imprecise
information or membership function, and generalizes well to more practical settings with noisy
labels. Some other works for individual imprecise label learning also related EM framework to their
proposed algorithms, but they usually involved the approximation on the EM algorithm (Amini &
Gallinari, 2002; Bekker & Goldberger, 2016; Wang et al., 2022a), while ILL is a complete EM view.
3 I MPRECISE LABEL LEARNING
Although current techniques demonstrate potential in addressing particular forms of imprecise labels,
they frequently fall short in adaptability and transferability to more complicated and more realistic
scenarios where multiple imprecise label types coexist. This section first defines the proposed
expectation-maximization (EM) formulation for learning with various imprecise labels. Then, we
demonstrate that our unified framework seamlessly extends to partial label learning, semi-supervised
label learning, noisy label learning, and the more challenging setting of mixed imprecise label learning.
Connections with previous pipelines can also be drawn clearly under the proposed framework.
3.1 A U NIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR LEARNING WITH IMPRECISE LABELS
Exploiting information from imprecise labels . The challenge of learning with imprecise labels lies
in learning effectively with inaccurate or incomplete annotation information. Per the analysis above,
prior works catering to specific individual imprecise labels either explicitly or implicitly attempt to
infer the precise labels from the imprecise label information. For example, partial label learning
4
Preprint
concentrates on the disambiguation of the ground truth label from the label candidates (Wang et al.,
2022a; Lian et al., 2022b; Xu et al., 2023) or averaging equally over the label candidates (Hüllermeier
& Beringer, 2006). In semi-supervised learning, after the model initially learns from the labeled data,
the pseudo-labels are treated as correct labels and utilized to conduct self-training on the unlabeled
data (Arazo et al., 2020; Sohn et al., 2020). Similarly, for noisy label learning, an integral part that
helps mitigate overfitting to random noise is the implementation of an accurate noise model capable
of identifying and rectifying the incorrect labels (Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022), thereby ensuring the
reliability of the learning process. However, inferring the correct labels from the imprecise labels or
utilizing the imprecise labels directly can be very challenging and usually leads to errors accumulated
during training (Arazo et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022), which is also known as the confirmation
bias. In this work, we take a different approach: we consider all possible labeling along with their
likelihood that the imprecise labels fulfill to train the model, rather than using a single rectified label
from the imprecise information. Such an approach also eliminates the requirements for designing
different methods for various imprecise label configurations and provides a unified solution instead.
A unified framework for learning with imprecise labels (ILL) . LetX={xi}i∈[N]represent the
features and Y={yi}i∈[N]represent their precise labels for the training data. Ideally, Ywould be
fully specified for X. In the imprecise label scenario, however, Yis not provided; instead we obtain
imprecise label information I. We view Inot as labels , but more abstractly as a variable representing
theinformation about the labels. From this perspective, the actual labels Ywould have a distribution
P(Y|I). When the information Iprovided is the precise true labels of the data, P(Y|I)would be a
delta distribution, taking a value 1at the true label, and 0elsewhere. If Irepresents partial labels,
thenP(Y|I)would have non-zero value over the candidate labels, and be 0elsewhere. When I
represents a set of noisy labels, P(Y|I)would represent the distribution of the true labels, given the
noisy labels. When Idoes not contain any information, i.e., unlabeled data, Ycan take any value.
By the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle, we must estimate the model to maximize the
likelihood of the data/information we have been provided, namely XandI. LetP(X, I;θ)represent
a parametric form for the joint distribution of XandI3Explicitly considering the labels Y, we have
P(X, I;θ) =P
YP(X, Y, I ;θ). The maximum likelihood principle requires us to find:
θ∗= arg max
θlogP(X, I;θ) = arg max
θlogX
YP(X, Y, I ;θ), (4)
withθ∗denotes the optimal value of θ. Eq. (4) features the log of an expectation and cannot generally
be solved in closed form, and requires iterative hill-climbing solutions. Of these, arguably the most
popular is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977), which iteratively
maximizes a tight variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. In our case, applying it becomes:
θt+1= arg max
θEY|X,I;θt[logP(X, Y, I ;θ)]
= arg max
θEY|X,I;θt[logP(Y|X;θ) + log P(I|X, Y;θ)],(5)
where θtis the tthestimate of the optimal θ. The detailed derivation of the variational lower
bound is shown in Appendix C.1. There are several implications from Eq. (5). (i) The expectation
over the posterior P(Y|X, I;θt)equates to considering alllabeling entailed by the imprecise label
information I, rather than any single (possibly corrected) choice of label. The computing of the
posterior conditioned on imprecise label information Ican be related to a non-deterministic finite
automaton (NFA) (Hopcroft et al., 2001); details are in Appendix C.3. (ii) The property of the second
term logP(I|X, Y;θ)is dependent on the nature of imprecise label I. IfIcontains information
about the true labels Y, such as the actual labels or the label candidates, it can be reduced to P(I|Y),
i.e., the probability of Iis no longer dependent on Xorθand thus can be ignored from Eq. (5). If I
represents the noisy labels, P(I|X, Y;θ)instead includes a potentially learnable noise model. (iii) It
is a general framework towards the unification of any label configuration, including full labels, partial
labels, low-resource labels, noisy labels, etc. In this work, we specialize this solution to partial label
learning, semi-supervised learning, noisy label learning, and the mixture of them below.
3The actual parameters θmay apply only to some component such as P(Y|X;θ)of the overall distribution;
we will nonetheless tag the entire distribution P(X, I;θ)withθto indicate that it is dependent on θoverall.

3.2 I NSTANTIATING THE UNIFIED EM F ORMULATION
We illustrate how to seamlessly expand the formulation from Eq. (5) to partial label learning, semi-
supervised learning, and noisy label learning, and derive the loss function4for each setting here. The
actual imprecise labels only affect the manner in which the posterior P(Y|X, I;θt)is computed
for each setting. We show that all learning objectives derived from Eq. (5) naturally include a
consistency term with the posterior as the soft target. We also demonstrate that the proposed unified
EM framework closely connects with the prior arts, which reveals the potential reason behind the
success of these techniques. Note that while we only demonstrate the application of the unified
framework to three learning paradigms here, it is flexible and can expand to learning with a mixture
of imprecise labels with robust performance, as we will show in Appendix C.2 and Section 4.4.
Partial label learning (PLL) . The imprecise label Ifor partial labels is defined as the label candidate
setsS={si}i∈[N]containing the true labels. These partial labels indicate that the posterior
P(Y|X, S;θt)can only assign its masses on the candidate labels. Since Scontains the information
about the true labels Y,P(S|X, Y;θ)reduces to P(S|Y), and thus can be ignored, as we discussed
earlier. Substituting Sin Eq. (5), we have the loss function of PLL derived using ILL:
LPLL
ILL=−X
Y∈[C]P(Y|X, S;θt) logP(Y|X;θ) =LCE 
p(y|As(x);θ),p(y|Aw(x),s;θt)
,(6)
where p(y|Aw(x),s;θt)is the normalized probability thatP
k∈Cpk= 1, and pk= 0,∀k∈s.
Eq. (6) corresponds exactly to consistency regularization (Xie et al., 2020a), with the normalized
predicted probability as the soft pseudo-targets. This realization on PLL shares similar insights as
(Wu et al., 2022) which exploits a gradually induced loss weight for PLL on multiple augmentations
of the data. However, our framework is much simpler and more concise as shown in ??.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) In SSL, the input Xconsists of the labeled data XLand the
unlabeled data XU. The imprecise label for SSL is realized as the limited number of full labels
YLforXL. The labels YUfor unlabeled XUare unknown and become the latent variable. Inter-
estingly, for the unlabeled data, there is no constraint on possible labels it can take. The posterior
P(YU|XL, XU, YL;θ), which is the actual prediction from the network, can be directly utilized as
soft targets for self-training. Since YLis conditionally independent with YUgiven X, the second
term of Eq. (5): P(YL|XL, XU, YU;θ), is reduced to P(YL|XL;θ), which corresponds to the
supervised objective on labeled data. The loss function for SSL using ILL thus becomes:
LSSL
ILL=−X
Y∈[C]P(YU|XU, XL, YL;θt) logP(YU|XU, XL;θ)−logP(YL|XL;θ)
=LCE 
p(y|As(xu);θ),p(y|Aw(xu);θt)
+LCE 
p(y|Aw(xL);θ), yL(7)
The first term corresponds to the unsupervised consistency regularization usually employed in SSL,
and the second term refers to the supervised CE loss only on labeled data. Eq. (7) has several
advantages over the previous methods. It adopts the prediction as soft-targets of all possible labeling
on unlabeled data, potentially circumventing the confirmation bias caused by pseudo-labeling and
naturally utilizing all unlabeled data which resolves the quantity-quality trade-off commonly existing
in SSL (Sohn et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023). It also indicates that previous pseudo-labeling with
confidence threshold implicitly conducts the EM optimization, where the maximal probable prediction
approximates the expectation, and the degree of the approximation is determined by the threshold τ.
Noisy label learning (NLL) . Things become more complicated here since the noisy labels ˆYdo not
directly reveal the true information about Y, thus P(ˆY|Y, X;θ)inherently involves a noise model that
needs to be learned. We define a simplified instance-independent5noise transition model T(ˆY|Y;ω)
with parameters ω, and take a slightly different way to formulate the loss function for NLL:
LNLL
ILL=−X
Y∈[C]P(Y|X,ˆY;θt, ωt) logP(Y|X,ˆY;θ, ωt)−logP(ˆY|X;θ, ω)
=LCE 
p(y|As(x),ˆy;θ, ωt),p(y|Aw(x),ˆy;θt, ωt)
+LCE(p(ˆy|Aw(x);θ, ω),ˆy),(8)
4To formulate the loss function, we convert the problem to minimization of the negative log-likelihood.
5A more complicated instance-dependent noise model T(ˆY|Y, X;ω)can also be formulated under our
unified framework, but not considered in this work.

4 E XPERIMENTS
In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate ILL. Albeit simple, the ILL framework
achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance regarding previous methods on partial label learning,
semi-supervised learning, and noisy label learning. Moreover, our experiments show that ILL could
be easily extended to a more practical setting with a mixture of various imprecise label configurations.
For all settings, we additionally adopt an entropy loss for balancing learned cluster sizes (John Bridle,
1991; Joulin & Bach, 2012), similarly as (Liu et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). All experiments are
conducted with three random seeds using NVIDIA V100 GPUs.
4.1 P ARTIAL LABEL LEARNING
Setup . Following (Wang et al., 2022a), we evaluate our method on partial label learning setting using
CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009), and CUB-200 (Welinder
et al., 2010). We generate partially labeled datasets by flipping negative labels to false positive labels
with a probability q, denoted as a partial ratio. The C−1negative labels are uniformly aggregated into
the ground truth label to form a set of label candidates. We consider q∈ {0.1,0.3,0.5}for CIFAR-10,
q∈ {0.01,0.05,0.1}for CIFAR-100, and q= 0.05for CUB-200. We choose six baselines for PLL
using ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016): LWS (Wen et al., 2021), PRODEN (Lv et al., 2020), CC (Feng
et al., 2020b), MSE and EXP (Feng et al., 2020a), and PiCO (Wang et al., 2022a). The detailed
hyper-parameters and comparison with the more recent method R-CR (Wu et al., 2022) that utilizes a
different training recipe and model (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) are shown in Appendix D.2.2.
Results . The results for PLL are shown in Table 1. Our method achieves the best performance
compared to the baseline methods. Perhaps more surprisingly, on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our
method even outperforms the fully-supervised reference, indicating the potential better generalization
capability using the proposed framework, sharing similar insights as (Wu et al., 2022). While PiCO
adopts a contrastive learning objective, our method still surpasses PiCO by an average of 2.13%
on CIFAR-10 and 2.72%on CIFAR-100. Our approach can be further enhanced by incorporating
contrastive learning objectives, potentially leading to more significant performance improvements.
4.2 S EMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING
Setup . For experiments of SSL, we follow the training and evaluation protocols of USB (Wang
et al., 2022d) on image and text classification. To construct the labeled dataset for semi-supervised
learning, we uniformly select l/Csamples from each class and treat the remaining samples as the
unlabeled dataset. We present the results on CIFAR-100 and STL-10 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009) for
image classification, and IMDB (Maas et al., 2011) and Amazon Review (McAuley & Leskovec,

such as FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020), AdaMatch (Berthelot et al., 2021), FlexMatch (Zhang et al.,
2021b), FreeMatch (Wang et al., 2023), and SoftMatch (Chen et al., 2023). We also compare with
methods with the contrastive loss, CoMatch (Li et al., 2021a) and SimMatch (Zheng et al., 2022). A
full comparison of the USB datasets and hyper-parameters are shown in Appendix D.3.
Results . We present the results for SSL on Table 2. Although no individual SSL algorithm dominates
the USB benchmark (Wang et al., 2022d), our method still shows competitive performance. Notably,
our method performs best on STL-10 with 40 labels and Amazon Review with 250 labels, outper-
forming the previous best by 0.68%and1.33%. In the other settings, the performance of our method
is also very close to the best-performing methods. More remarkably, our method does not employ
any thresholding, re-weighting, or contrastive techniques to achieve current results, demonstrating a
significant potential to be further explored in SSL for even better performance.
4.3 N OISY LABEL LEARNING
Setup . We conduct the experiments of NLL following SOP (Liu et al., 2022) on both synthetic
symmetric/asymmetric noise on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and more realistic and larger-scale
instance noise on Clothing1M (Xiao et al., 2015b), and WebVision (Li et al., 2017). To introduce the
synthetic symmetric noise to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we uniformly flip labels for a probability
ηinto other classes. For asymmetric noise, we only randomly flip the labels for particular pairs of
classes. We mainly select three previous best methods as baselines: DivideMix (Li et al., 2020); ELR
(Liu et al., 2020); and SOP (Liu et al., 2022). We also include the normal cross-entropy (CE) training
and mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) as baselines. More comparisons regarding other methods (Patrini
et al., 2016; Han et al., 2018) and on CIFAR-10N (Wei et al., 2021) are shown in Appendix D.4.
Results . We present the noisy label learning results in Table 3. The proposed method is comparable
to the previous best methods. On synthetic noise of CIFAR-10, our method demonstrates the best
performance on both symmetric noise and asymmetric noise. On CIFAR-100, our method generally
produces similar results comparable to SOP. One may notice that our method shows inferior perfor-
mance on asymmetric noise of CIFAR-100; we argue this is mainly due to the oversimplification of
the noise transition model. Our method also achieves the best results on WebVision, outperforming the
previous best by 2.05%. On Clothing1M, our results are also very close to DivideMix, which trains
for 80 epochs compared to 10 epochs in ours, and no doubt further training improves performance.

4.4 M IXED IMPRECISE LABEL LEARNING
Setup . We evaluate on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 in a more challenging and realistic setting, the
mixture of various imprecise label configurations, with unlabeled, partially labeled, and noisy labeled
data existing simultaneously. We first sample the labeled dataset and treat other samples as the
unlabeled. On the labeled dataset, we generate partial labels and randomly corrupt the true label of
the partial labels. We set l∈ {1000,5000,50000}for CIFAR-10, and l∈ {5000,10000 ,50000}for
CIFAR-100. For partial labels, we set q∈ {0.1,0.3,0.5}for CIFAR-10, and q∈ {0.01,0.05,0.1}
for CIFAR-100. For noisy labels, we set η∈ {0,0.1,0.2,0.3}for both datasets. Since there is no
prior work that can handle all settings all at once, we compare on partial noisy label learning with
PiCO+ (Wang et al., 2022b), IRNet (Lian et al., 2022b), and DALI (Xu et al., 2023).6
Results . We report the comparison with partial noisy label learning methods in Table 4. Compared
to previous methods, the proposed method achieves the best performance. Despite the simplicity,
our method outperforms PiCO+ and DALI with mixup, showing the effectiveness of dealing with
mixed imprecise labels. We also report the results of our methods on more mixed imprecise label
configurations in Table 5. Our method demonstrates significant robustness against various settings of
the size of labeled data, partial ratio, and noise ratio. Note that this is the first work that naturally deals
with all three imprecise label configurations simultaneously, with superior performance than previous
methods handling specific types or combinations of label configurations. This indicates the enormous
potential of our work in realistic applications for handling more complicated data annotations.
5 C ONCLUSION
We present the imprecise label learning (ILL) framework, a unified and consolidated solution for
learning from all types of imprecise labels. ILL effectively employs an expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the distribution over the latent ground
truth labels Y, imprecise label information I, and data X. It naturally extends and encompasses
previous formulations for various imprecise label settings, achieving promising results. Notably, in
scenarios where mixed configurations of imprecise labels coexist, our method exhibits substantial
robustness against diverse forms of label imprecision. The potential broader impact of the ILL
framework is substantial. It stands poised to transform domains where obtaining precise labels poses
a challenge, offering a simple, unified, and effective approach to such contexts. Beyond the three
6Although there are also prior efforts on partial semi-supervised learning (Wang et al., 2019b; Wang & Zhang,
2020), they do not scale on simple dataset even on CIFAR-10. Thus, they are ignored for comparison.

Preprint
imprecise label configurations we have demonstrated in this study, the ILL framework shows promise
for an extension to more intricate scenarios such as multi-instance learning (Ilse et al., 2018) and
multi-label crowd-sourcing learning (Ibrahim et al., 2023). However, it is also crucial to acknowledge
thelimitations of the ILL framework. Although its effectiveness has been substantiated on relatively
smaller-scale datasets, additional empirical validation is necessary to assess its scalability to larger
datasets. Furthermore, our study only considers balanced datasets; thus, the performance of the ILL
framework when dealing with imbalanced data and open-set data still remains an open area for future
exploration. We anticipate that our study will constitute a significant stride towards a comprehensive
solution for imprecise label learning and catalyze further research in this crucial field.

B R ELATED WORK
Many previous methods have been proposed for dealing with the specific types and some combinations
of imprecise label configurations. In the main paper, we only introduced the representative pipelines
for partial label learning, semi-supervised learning, and noisy label learning, as shown in Section 2.
In this section, we discuss in more detail the previous methods. We also extend discussions about the
imprecise label settings to multi-instance learning and mixed imprecise label learning.
B.1 P ARTIAL LABEL LEARNING
Label ambiguity remains a fundamental challenge in Partial Label Learning (PLL). The most straight-
forward approach to handling PLL is the average-based method, which assumes an equal probability
for each candidate label being the ground-truth label. For instance, Hüllermeier & Beringer (2006)
employed k-nearest neighbors for label disambiguation, treating all candidate labels of a sample’s
neighborhood equally and predicting the ground-truth label through voting strategies. However, a
significant drawback of average-based methods is that false positive labels can mislead them.
To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored identification-based methods for PLL. In
contrast to average-based methods, which treat all candidate labels equally, identification-based

methods view the ground-truth label as a latent variable. They seek to maximize its estimated
probability using either the maximum margin criterion (Nguyen & Caruana, 2008; Zhang et al.,
2016b) or the maximum likelihood criterion (Liu & Dietterich, 2012). Deep learning techniques
have recently been incorporated into identification-based methods, yielding promising results across
multiple datasets. For example, PRODEN (Lv et al., 2020) proposed a self-training strategy that
disambiguates candidate labels using model outputs. CC (Feng et al., 2020b) introduced classifier-
consistent and risk-consistent algorithms, assuming uniform candidate label generation. LWS (Wen
et al., 2021) relaxed this assumption and proposed a family of loss functions for label disambiguation.
More recently, Wang et al. (2022a) incorporated contrastive learning into PLL, enabling the model to
learn discriminative representations and show promising results under various levels of ambiguity.
Nevertheless, these methods rely on the fundamental assumption that the ground-truth label is present
in the candidate set. This assumption may not always hold, especially in cases of unprofessional
judgments by annotators, which could limit the applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios.
B.2 S EMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING
Consistency regularization and self-training, inspired by clusterness and smoothness assumptions,
have been proposed to encourage the network to generate similar predictions for inputs under varying
20
Preprint
perturbations (Tarvainen & Valpola, 2017; Samuli & Timo, 2017; Miyato et al., 2018). Self-training
(Lee et al., 2013; Arazo et al., 2020; Sohn et al., 2020) is a widely-used approach for leveraging
unlabeled data. Pseudo Label (Lee et al., 2013), a well-known self-training technique, iteratively
creates pseudo labels that are then used within the same model. However, this approach suffers from
confirmation bias (Arazo et al., 2020), where the model struggles to rectify its own errors when
learning from inaccurate pseudo labels. Recent studies focus largely on generating high-quality
pseudo-labels. MixMatch (Berthelot et al., 2019b), for instance, generates pseudo labels by averaging
predictions from multiple augmentations. Other methods like ReMixMatch (Berthelot et al., 2019a),
UDA (Xie et al., 2020a), and FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020) adopt confidence thresholds to generate
pseudo labels for weakly augmented samples, which are then used to annotate strongly augmented
samples. Methods such as Dash (Xu et al., 2021), FlexMatch (Zhang et al., 2021b), and FreeMatch
(Wang et al., 2023) dynamically adjust these thresholds following a curriculum learning approach.
SoftMatch (Chen et al., 2023) introduces a novel utilization of pseudo-labels through Gaussian
re-weighting. Label Propagation methods (Iscen et al., 2019) assign pseudo labels based on the
local neighborhood’s density. Meta Pseudo Labels (Pham et al., 2021) proposes generating pseudo
labels with a meta learner. SSL learning has also seen improvements through the incorporation of
contrastive loss (Li et al., 2021a; Zheng et al., 2022). Furthermore, MixUp (Zhang et al., 2017) has
shown its effectiveness in a semi-supervised learning (SSL) (Berthelot et al., 2019b;a; Cai et al.,
2022).
B.3 N OISY LABEL LEARNING
Due to their large number of parameters, deep neural networks are prone to overfitting to noisy labels.
Although certain popular regularization techniques like mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) can somewhat
mitigate overfitting, they fall short of completely resolving the issue of learning with noisy labels,
as they lack accurate noise modeling. Numerous techniques have been proposed to handle Noisy
Label Learning (NLL) (Song et al., 2022). They can broadly be divided into three categories: robust
loss functions (Ghosh et al., 2017; Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Wang et al., 2019c; Ma et al., 2020b),
noise estimation (Xiao et al., 2015a; Goldberger & Ben-Reuven, 2016; Liu et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,
2021d; Northcutt et al., 2021), and noise correction (Han et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022).
Designing loss functions that are robust to noise is a well-explored strategy for tackling the label
noise problem. The l1loss [59], which is a robust loss function, is a popular choice and has seen
many recent extensions (Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Wang et al., 2019c; Ma et al., 2020a; Yu et al.,
2020). Additionally, methods that re-weight loss (Liu & Tao, 2016) have also been explored for
learning with noisy labels. However, despite enabling the model to learn faster from accurate labels,
these robust loss functions still lead to overfitting to corrupted labels when used with models having
a large number of parameters.
Another common strategy to handle label noise involves assuming that the noisy label originates
from a probability distribution that depends on the actual label. The key task here is to estimate the
underlying transition probabilities. Early works (Goldberger & Ben-Reuven, 2016) incorporated
these transition probabilities into a noise adaptation layer that is stacked over a classification network
and trained in an end-to-end fashion. More recent work, such as Forward (Patrini et al., 2016),
prefers to estimate these transition probabilities using separate procedures. However, the success of
this method is contingent upon the availability of clean validation data (Northcutt et al., 2021) or
additional assumptions about the data (Zhang et al., 2021e).
Noise correction has shown promising results in noisy label learning recently. During the early
learning phase, the model can accurately predict a subset of the mislabeled examples (Liu et al.,
2020). This observation suggests a potential strategy of correcting the corresponding labels. This
could be accomplished by generating new labels equivalent to soft or hard pseudo-labels estimated
by the model (Tanaka et al., 2018; Yi & Wu, 2019). Co-Teaching uses multiple differently trained
networks for correcting noisy labels (Han et al., 2018). SELFIE (Song et al., 2019) corrects a subset
of labels by replacing them based on past model outputs. Another study in Arazo et al. (2019)
uses a two-component mixture model for sample selection, and then corrects labels using a convex
combination. They also utilize mixup (Zhang et al., 2017) to enhance performance. Similarly,
DivideMix (Li et al., 2020) employs two networks for sample selection using a two-component
mixture model and implements the semi-supervised learning technique MixMatch (Berthelot et al.,
2019b).

B.4 M ULTI -INSTANCE LEARNING
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a sub-field of supervised learning where each instance is
associated with a label. However, MIL stands out due to its handling of incomplete label knowledge
in the training set. The training data in MIL is composed of ’bags’, each containing several unlabeled
instances. The primary objective of MIL is to predict labels for new, unseen bags. Dietterich et al.
(1997) pioneered the concept of MIL, specifically applying it to drug activity prediction. This
innovative approach has since inspired the development of numerous algorithms tailored to tackle
this distinctive problem. One pragmatic approach for dealing with label noise in this context involves
counting the number of positive instances within a bag and setting a threshold for classifying positive
bags. This technique was encapsulated as the threshold-based assumption for MIL in (Foulds & Frank,
2010). Per this assumption, a bag is classified as positive if and only if the count of positive instances
exceeds a predefined threshold. This constituted the initial integration of counting information into
the MIL framework. Following this development, various efforts (Tao et al., 2004a;b) focused on
carrying out bag-level predictions based on count-based assumptions.
Another significant trajectory in MIL research is centered on instance-level prediction. The framework
proposed by Maron & Lozano-Pérez (1997) is particularly renowned for instance-level prediction
within the MIL paradigm. This framework has underpinned numerous research proposals that have
demonstrated effectiveness. The foundational idea behind these frameworks is the dynamic or static
labeling of instances according to the bag label. Empirical studies, as detailed in (Vanwinckelen et al.,
2016), have illustrated that superior bag-level prediction does not necessarily guarantee improved
instance-level prediction. To further the field of MIL, addressing these critical issues will be essential
in order to develop more robust, flexible, and scalable MIL methods that can be applied across a
broad range of real-world situations (Zhang et al., 2021a).
B.5 M IXED IMPRECISE LABEL LEARNING
Various previous works have explored dealing with distinct types of imprecise labels. However, they
have yet to tackle a combination of partial labels, limited labels, and noisy labels, which is a highly
realistic scenario. For instance, recent attention has been paid to the issue of partial noisy label
learning.
PiCO+ (Wang et al., 2022b), an extended version of PiCO (Wang et al., 2022a), is tailored specifically
for partial noisy labels. It employs a distance-based method to select clean samples and uses a
semi-supervised contrastive learning algorithm to train robust classifiers. This approach distinguishes
between clean and noisy samples and enhances the learning of distinctive features. IRNet (Lian
et al., 2022b) is a novel framework designed for Partial Label Learning with noisy labels. It uses two
modules: noisy sample detection and label correction, transforming the scenario of noisy PLL into a
more traditional PLL. DALI (Xu et al., 2023) is another framework designed to reduce the negative
impact of detection errors by creating a balance between the initial candidate set and model outputs,
with theoretical assurances of its effectiveness.
Additionally, some work has focused on semi-supervised partial label learning (Wang et al., 2019b;
Wang & Zhang, 2020). An iterative label propagation process is proposed in these studies, operating
between partially labeled examples and unlabeled instances, which helps clarify the candidate label
sets of the partially labeled examples and assign valid labels to unlabeled instances. However, these
methods don’t scale well to larger datasets like CIFAR-10.
Our study and the proposed framework hold significant importance as we have not found any existing
research that can effectively address the challenge of handling a combination of partial, limited, and
noisy labels simultaneously. This underscores the novelty and significance of our work, making it a
valuable contribution to the field of machine learning.

C.1 D ERIVATION OF VARIATIONAL LOWER BOUND
Evidence lower bound (ELBO), or equivalently variational lower bound (Dempster et al., 1977), is
the core quantity in EM. From Eq. (5), to model logP(X, I;θ), we have:
logP(X, I;θ) =Z
Q(Y) logP(X, I;θ)dY
=Z
Q(Y) logP(X, I;θ)P(Y|X, I;θ)
P(Y|X, I;θ)dY
=Z
Q(Y) logP(X, I, Y ;θ)Q(Y)
P(Y|X, I;θ)Q(Y)dY
=Z
Q(Y) logP(X, I, Y ;θ)
Q(Y)dY−Z
Q(Y) logP(Y|X, I;θ)
Q(Y)dY(10)
where the first term is the ELBO and the second term is the KL divergence
DKL(Q(Y)||P(Y|X, I;θ)). Replacing Q(Y)with P(Y|X, I;θt)at each iteration will ob-
tain Eq. (5).
C.2 I NSTANTIATIONS MIXED IMPRECISE LABEL LEARNING
In this setting, we have both labeled data and unlabeled data, where the labels for the labeled data
are both partial and noisy. On the unlabeled data, the unsupervised objective is the same as the
unsupervised consistency regularization of semi-supervised learning shown in Eq. (7). On the labeled
data, it mainly follows the Eq. (9) of noisy label learning, with the noisy single label becoming the
noisy partial labels ˆs. For noisy partial labels, the noisy supervised objective in Eq. 8 becomes the
supervised consistency regularization as in Eq. 6 of partial label setting to train the noise transition
model, and the noisy unsupervised objective becomes the consistency regularization of the prediction
conditioned on noisy partial labels:
LCE 

y| As(x),ˆs;θ, ωt
,p 
y| Aw(x),ˆy;θt, ωt
+LCE(p(ˆy| Aw(x);θ, ω),ˆs) (11)
We can compute both quantity through the noise transition model:
p(y|x,ˆs;θ, ωt)∝p(y|x;θ)Y
ˆy∈ˆsT(y|ˆy;ωt),andp(ˆy|x;θ, ω) =X
y∈[C]p(y|x;θ)T(ˆy|y;ω).(12)
C.3 F ORWARD -BACKWARD ALGORITHM ON THE NFA OFIMPRECISE LABELS
This section provides an alternative explanation for the EM framework proposed in the main paper.
We treat the problem of assigning labels Yto inputs Xas generating a sequence of symbols Y,
such that Iis satisfied. Such a process can be represented as a finite-state automaton (FSA); more
specifically, a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) (Hopcroft et al., 2001). The NFA of imprecise
labels can be formally defined with a finite set of states X, a finite set of symbols Y, a transition
function f◦g, a start state of x0, and the accepting state of I, determining the available transition
paths in the NFA, as shown in Fig. 3. We demonstrate that, Although we can directly derive the
23
Preprint
soft-targets utilized in loss functions of each setting we study from Eq. (5), they can also be computed
by performing a forward-backward algorithm on the NFA. While there is no difference in the actual
value for conducting the forward-backward algorithm and deriving the soft-targets directly, the NFA
indeed becomes more necessary when only collection-level imprecise information is provided, where
naively considering all possible labeling requires exponential complexity, and forward-backward
on NFA reduces the complexity to linear. The reason for the equivalence in the partial, semi-sup,
noisy label is because the NFA directly collapses to O(1)for computing the posterior without any
statistical information imposed from I.
To compute the posterior probability P(Y|X, I;θ), without loss of generality, we assume each
training sample is drawn independently and identically, and training samples occur as a permutation-
invariant sequence. We further assume that each yiis conditionally independent given the whole
sequence of training samples X, which allows us to re-write Eq. (5) as:
θt+1= arg max
θX
i∈[N]X
y∈[C]P(yi=y|X, I;θt) [log P(yi=y|X;θ) + log P(I|X, Y;θ)].(13)
The problem of computing the posterior then reduces to calculate the joint probability of Iand the
latent ground truth label of the i-th sample taking the value ygiven the whole input sequence X:
P(yi=y|X, I;θt) =P(yi=y, I|X;θt)
P(I|X;θt). (14)
Subsequently, P(yi=y, I|X;θt)can be computed in linear time complexity O(NC)at maximum
using the forward-backward algorithm on the NFA, similar to connectionist temporal classification
(CTC) (Graves et al., 2006). More specifically, for any symbol yiin the NFA of imprecise label
information, the joint is calculated with the forward score α(i, y)and the backward score β(i, y):
α(i, y) =X
y′∈yi−1|Iα(i−1, y′)P(yi=y|X;θt),
ˆβ(i, y) =P(yi=y|X;θt)X
y′∈∈yi+1|Iβ(i+ 1, y′), β(i, y) =ˆβ(i, y)
P(yi=y|X;θt),(15)
where α(i, y)indicates the total probability of all paths of Iat state xiandβ(i, y)indicates the total
probability of all paths of Iat state xi. We can then compute the posterior probability:
P(yi=y|X, I;θt) =α(i, y)β(i, y)P
y′∈[ι]iα(i, y′)β(i, y′), (16)
which can be in turn used in Eq. (5). Now the difference in learning with various imprecise label
configurations lies only in how to construct the NFA graph for different configurations.
An illustration for the NFA of full labels, partial labels, limited labels with unlabeled data, and noisy
labels is shown in Fig. 3. For full precise labels, there is only one determined transition of Y. For
partial labels, the transition paths can only follow the label candidates, resulting in the normalized
soft-targets with masses on the label candidates as we shown in Section 3.2. For semi-supervised
learning, the transition paths for the labeled data strictly follow YL. For unlabeled data, since
there is no constraint on the transition paths, all transitions are possible, corresponding to the soft
pseudo-targets. For noisy labels, all transition paths are possible, but the joint probability needs to be
computed with the noise transition model. We will show, in future work, the more extensions of the
ILL framework on collection-level and statistical imprecise labels, with the help of NFA.
D E XPERIMENTS
D.1 A DDITIONAL TRAINING DETAILS
We adopt two additional training strategies for the ILL framework. The first is the “strong-weak”
augmentation strategy (Xie et al., 2020a). Since there is a consistency regularization term in each
imprecise label formulation of ILL, we use the soft pseudo-targets of the weakly-augmented data
to train the strongly-augmented data. The second is the entropy loss (John Bridle, 1991) for class
balancing, which is also adopted in SOP (Liu et al., 2022) and FreeMatch (Wang et al., 2023). We set
the loss weight for the entropy loss uniformly for all experiments as 0.1.

D.2 P ARTIAL LABEL LEARNING
D.2.1 S ETUP
Following previous work (Xu et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022a), we evaluate our
method on partial label learning setting using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CUB-200 (Welinder
et al., 2010). We generate partially labeled datasets by flipping negative labels to false positive
labels with a probability q, which is also denoted as a partial ratio. Specifically, the C−1negative
labels are uniformly aggregated into the ground truth label to form a set of label candidates. We
consider q∈ {0.1,0.3,0.5}for CIFAR-10, q∈ {0.01,0.05,0.1}for CIFAR-100, and q= 0.05for
CUB-200. For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we use ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) as backbone. We use
SGD as an optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 1e−3.
For CUB-200, we initialize the ResNet-18 (He et al., 2016) with ImageNet-1K (Deng et al., 2009)
pre-trained weights. We train 800epochs for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (Krizhevsky et al., 2009),
and300epochs for CUB-200, with a cosine learning rate scheduler. For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
we use an input image size of 32. For CUB-200, we use an input image size of 224. A batch size
of 256 is used for all datasets. The choice of these parameters mainly follows PiCO (Wang et al.,
2022a). We present the full hyper-parameters systematically in Table 7.

We additionally compare our method with R-CR (Wu et al., 2022), which uses a different architecture
as the results in Table 1. R-CR uses Wide-ResNet34x10 as backbone, and adopts multiple strong data
augmentations. It also adjusts the loss weight along training. For fair comparison, we use the same
architecture without multiple augmentation and the curriculum adjust on loss. The results are shown
in Table 8, where our method outperforms R-CR on CIFAR-10 and is comparable on CIFAR-100.

A recent work on PLL discussed and analyzed the robustness performance of different loss functions,
especially the average-based methods (Lv et al., 2023). We perform a similar analysis here for the
derived loss function in ILL. Following the notation in Lv et al. (2023), let sdenote the candidate
label set, xas the training instance, gas the probability score from the model, and fas the classifier
f(x) = arg max
i∈Ygi(x), the average-based PLL can be formulated as:
Lavg−PLL(f(x),s) =1
|s|X
i∈sℓ(f(x), i) (17)
Lv et al. (2023) compared different loss functions ℓon both noise-free and noisy PLL settings, where
they find both theoretically and empirically that average-based PLL with bounded loss are robust
under mild assumptions. Empirical study in Lv et al. (2023) suggests that both Mean Absolute Error
andGeneralized Cross-Entropy loss (Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018) that proposed for noisy label learning
achieves the best performance and robustness for average-based PLL.
25
Preprint
Our solution for PLL can be viewed as an instantiation of the average-based PLL as in (Lv et al.,
2023) with:
ℓ(f(x), i) =−¯gi(x) loggi(x) (18)
where ¯gis normalized probability over swith detached gradient. We can further show that the above
loss function is bounded for 0< ℓ≤1
eand thus bounded for summation of all classes, which
demonstrates robustness, as we show in Table 4.

D.4 N OISY LABEL LEARNING
D.4.1 S ETUP
We conduct experiments of noisy label learning following SOP (Liu et al., 2022). We evaluate the
proposed method on both synthetic symmetric/asymmetric noise on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
and more realistic and larger-scale instance noise on Clothing1M and WebVision. To introduce the
synthetic symmetric noise to CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we uniformly flip labels for a probability
ηinto other classes. For asymmetric noise, we only randomly flip the labels for particular pairs of
classes. For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we train PreAct-ResNet-18 with SGD using a learning rate
of0.02, a weight decay of 1e−3, and a momentum of 0.9. We train for 300epochs with a cosine
learning rate schedule and a batch size of 128. For WebVision, we use InceptionResNet-v2 as the
backbone and set the batch size to 32. Other settings are similar to CIFAR-10. For Clothing1M,
we use ImageNet-1K pre trained ResNet-50 as the backbone. We train it using SGD with an initial
learning rate of 2e-3for a total of 10 epochs, where the learning rate is reduced by 10 after 5 epochs.
In addition, we also conduct experiments on CIFAR-10N and CIFAR-100N. We present the detailed
hyper-parameters in Table 13.
D.4.2 R ESULTS
In addition to the results regarding noisy label learning provided in the main paper, we also present
comparison results on CIFAR-10N and CIFAR-100N (Wei et al., 2021) in Table 14. We include a
full comparison on Clothing1M and WebVision, incorporating methods like Co-Teaching, Forward,
and CORES, in Table 15. As shown in Table 14, the proposed ILL framework achieves performance
comparable to the previous best method, SOP (Liu et al., 2022). On CIFAR-10N, our method yields
results very close to SOP in the Random and Aggregate case noise scenarios and surpasses SOP in the

Worst case noise scenario. However, on CIFAR-100N, our method slightly underperforms previous
methods, possibly due to the oversimplified noise model utilized in ILL. We believe that a more
realistic noise transition model and further tuning of our method could lead to improved performance.

D.5 M IXED IMPRECISE LABEL LEARNING
D.5.1 S ETUP
To create a mixture of various imprecise label configurations, we select CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as
base datasets. We first uniformly sample l/Clabeled samples from each class to form the labeled
dataset and treat the remaining samples as the unlabeled dataset. Based on the labeled dataset, we
generate partially labeled datasets by flipping negative labels to false positive labels with the partial
ratioq. After obtaining the partial labels, we randomly select ηpercentage of samples from each class,
and recreate the partial labels for them by flipping the ground truth label uniformly to another class.
In this setting, unlabeled data, partially labeled data, and noisy labeled data exist simultaneously,
which is very challenging and more closely resembles realistic situations. For CIFAR-10, we set
l∈ {1000,5000,50000}, and for CIFAR-100, we set l∈ {5000,10000 ,50000}. Similarly in
the partial label setting, we set q∈ {0.1,0.3,0.5}for CIFAR-10, and q∈ {0.01,0.05,0.1}for
CIFAR-100. For noisy labels, we set η∈ {0.1,0.2,0.3}for both datasets.

D.5.2 R ESULTS
We provide a more complete version of Table 4 in Table 16. On partial noisy labels of CIFAR-10 with
partial ratio 0.5and of CIFAR-100 with partial ratio 0.1, most baseline methods are more robust or
even fail to perform. However, our ILL still shows very robust performance with minor performance
degradation as increase of noise ratios.

full labels, partial ratio qof{0.1,0.3,0.5}for CIFAR-10 and {0.01,0.05,0.1}for CIFAR-100, and
noise ratio ηof{0.1,0.2,0.3}for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.
