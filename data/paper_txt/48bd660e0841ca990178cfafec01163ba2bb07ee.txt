Objective  Researches about the association between serum albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) and the prognosis of 
lung cancer are limited. We aimed to investigate the relationship between AGR and overall survival (OS) in patients 
with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anlotinib.
Methods  A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 196 advanced NSCLC patients with anlotinib treatment 
between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021. The exposure was AGR, calculated by baseline serum albumin / (serum total 
protein - serum albumin). The outcome was OS, defined as the period from the date of initial treatment with anlotinib 
to death or the last follow-up. The univariate and multivariate linear regression models and generalized additive 
models (GAM) were used to analyze the relationship between AGR and OS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to 
analyze the OS.
Results  After adjusting for potential confounders, a non-linear relationship was observed between AGR and OS, 
which had an inflection point of 1.24. The hazard ratio and the confidence intervals on the left and the right sides 
of the inflection point were 13.05 (0.52 to 327.64) and 0.20 (0.07 to 0.57), respectively. It suggested that AGR was 
positively associated with OS when AGR was larger than 1.24, for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death 
lowered approximately by 80%.Association between albumin-to-

Introduction
Recently, the epidemiological survey released that lung 
cancer is still the most diagnosed type of cancer, account -
ing for 20% of global cancer-related mortality [ 1, 2]. 
Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major type 
of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all 
primary lung cancers [ 3]. At present, in addition to the 
traditional treatment methods, the rapid development 
of targeted therapy and immunotherapy has significantly 
improved the survival of lung cancer patients. The appli -
cation of antiangiogenic drugs in lung cancer patients’ 
treatment is considered to have good therapeutic effects. 
Anlotinib is a selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibi -
tor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor recep -
tors, fibroblast growth factor receptors, platelet-derived 
growth factor receptor-α and c-Kit [ 4]. Based on the 
overall survival benefit observed in a randomized, dou -
ble-blind, multicenter, phase III trial (ALTER0303) 
[5], the China National Medical Products Administra -
tion approved anlotinib for the treatment of third-line 
advanced NSCLC. However, not all patients will benefit 
from anlotinib, thus, it is particularly of utmost impor -
tance to find prognostic biomarkers, which are simple, 
inexpensive and affordable, to select suitable patients. 
Albumin and globulin have attracted wide attention as 
non-invasive prognostic factors of tumors. Albumin can 
be used to reflect the nutritional and systemic inflam -
matory status of cancer patients and can be used as a 
prognostic marker for diverse cancers [ 6–10]. Globulin, 
as one of the main cortisol-binding proteins, can partici -
pate in immune and inflammatory responses [ 11]. As a 
combination of albumin and globulin, the albumin-to-
globulin ratio (AGR) reflects both nutritional status and 
inflammatory response [ 12], which has been reported 
to be associated with the prognosis of several cancers 
[10, 13–16].We suggest that AGR is a credible predic -
tive parameter for several reasons. Firstly, a lower AGR 
level can be attributed to reduced albumin levels and/or 
elevated globulin levels, encompassing both significant 
unfavorable predictors and potentially enhancing the 
accuracy of predictions compared to individual param -
eters. Secondly, the advantage of AGR lies in its relative 
insensitivity to conditions such as dehydration and fluid 
retention, which can cause fluctuations in albumin and 
globulin levels. However, so far, there is no study that 
have reported the relationship between AGR and overall 
survival (OS) of advanced NSCLC patients treated with 
anlotinib. Therefore, we retrospectively studied the rela -
tionship between AGR and OS with the hypothesis that AGR level can be an independent protective factor for 
OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib.
Methods
Study design and population
To explore the relationship between AGR and OS in 
patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC and treated 
with anlotinib, we conducted a retrospective cohort 
study. All patients included in this study were admitted 
to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medi -
cine of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University between 
June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021. Based on the inclusion cri -
teria as follows: (a) Patients with either histologically or 
cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC; (b) Patients 
with anlotinib treatment; (c) There was no concurrent 
malignancy or history of a second primary malignancy, a 
total of 306 patients were successive enrolled initially. In 
addition, patients who met the exclusion criteria as fol -
lows: (a) Patients without available follow-up data and 
records; (b) Patients treated with anlotinib for less than 
one cycle (12 mg, 10 mg or 8 mg once daily, 2 weeks on/ 
1 week off); (c) Patients were not at clinical stage III and 
IV (d) Patients with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) score higher than 
one, were not included in the final analysis.
Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, clini -
copathological characteristics, gene mutations, distant 
metastases, previous treatment information and com -
plete follow-up information were extracted from medical 
records or obtained from telephone follow-up. Labora -
tory values, including serum albumin and total protein, 
were collected at baseline within a week prior to the first 
dose of anlotinib.
The AGR value was defined as serum albumin / (serum 
total protein - serum albumin), as previously described 
[16]. OS was defined as the period from the date of ini -
tial treatment with anlotinib to death or the last follow-
up. Patient without smoking history was defined as 
never smoker. Clinical stages were determined by IASLC 
(International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) 
8th edition lung cancer staging system. Informed consent 
was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. 
The cutoff data for patients’ follow-up was November 1, 
2021.
Statistical analysis
The first step of data analysis was to present the baseline 
data distribution of patients enrolled in this study in dif -
ferent AGR groups (Tertile). We expressed continuous Conclusions  The relationship between AGR and the OS for advanced NSCLC patients with anlotinib is non-linear. 
AGR level is an independent protective factor for OS in advanced NSCLC patients who received anlotinib therapy.

variables as means ± standard deviations (normal distri -
bution) or medians (quartile) (skewed distribution). We 
expressed categorical variables as frequencies or per -
centages. We used chi-square test (categorical variables), 
One-Way ANOVA (normal distribution) and Kruskal-
Wallis H (skewed distribution) to calculate the differ -
ences among different AGR groups.
The second step of data analysis could be summarized 
as follows: (a) Is there a relationship between AGR and 
OS, is it linear or non-linear? (b) What factors inter -
fered with or modified the relationship between them? 
(c) What was the independent effect on AGR and OS 
when we exclude the effects of these potential confound -
ers or modifiers? In accordance with the above analytical 
principles, univariate and multivariate linear regression 
models were used to assess the associations between 
AGR and OS. As suggested by the recommendations of 
STROBE statement [ 17], we built three models including 
an unadjusted model, a model adjusted to demographics 
and a fully-adjusted model. For the fully-adjusted model, 
the adjusted variables were correlated covariates that may 
influence OS and/or AGR as reported in previous studies 
[6, 14, 16]. In addition, the subgroup analyses were exe -
cuted using stratified linear regression models after fully 
adjusted. Tests for effect modification by subgroups used 
the interaction terms between subgroup indicators, fol -
lowed by the likelihood ratio test. OS among AGR tertiles 
was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-
rank tests.
To ensure the robustness of the data analysis results, 
we conducted the following sensitivity analyses: (a) We 
converted the AGR into a categorical variable by tertile. 
The aim was to verify the results of AGR as a continu -
ous variable and to observe the possibility of nonlinearity. 
(b) Linear regression is a linear model that is calculated 
based on the fact that the relationships between the inde -
pendent variables and the dependent variables were lin -
ear. However, the relationships between the dependent 
variables and the independent variables are often non -
linear in biomedical data analysis. Thus, we used a gen -
eralized additive model (GAM) to explore the nonlinear 
relationships. (c) If the relationship between AGR and 
OS is nonlinear, a two-piecewise linear regression model 
would be constructed to figure out the threshold effect of 
the AGR on OS according to the smoothing plot. A recur -
sion algorithm was used to determine the saturation level 
of AGR, at which the relationship between AGR and OS 
began to change and became significant. The inflection 
point moved along a predefined interval and detected 
the inflection point that gave the maximum model like -
lihood. We determined the best fit model based on the 
p value of log-likelihood ratio tests. When the p value 
of log-likelihood ratio tests was greater than 0.05, there 
is no difference between the linear regression model and the two-piecewise linear model, and the linear model 
can be used to fit the relationship between AGR and OS. 
On the contrary, when the p value was less than 0.05, it 
is considered that the above-mentioned models were sig -
nificantly different, and we used the two-piecewise linear 
model to clarify the relationship between AGR and OS.
All the analyses were performed with the statistical 
software package R ( http://www.R-project.org , The R 
Foundation) and EmpowerStats ( http://www.empow -
erstats.com , X&Y solutions, Inc., Boston, MA). P values 
less than 0.05 (two-side) were considered statistically 
significant.
Results
The enrollment of participants
In total, 306 NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib were 
admitted to the Department of Pulmonary and Critical 
Care Medicine of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan Univer -
sity between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021. Of these, 110 
patients were excluded, including 10 patients who missed 
baseline data, 34 patients who lost to follow-up, 42 
patients who were treated with anlotinib for less than one 
cycle, 23 patients with a high ECOG PS score ( > 1) and 1 
patient who was not at clinical stage III and IV. Finally, 
196 selected participants were enrolled for data analysis 
(Fig.  1).
Baseline clinical characteristics
The median follow-up time was 7.64 (range 0.59 to 
32.98) months, and 97 patients died (49.49%). Baseline 
characteristics of selected participants according to ter -
tile of AGR are shown in Table  1. In general, the aver -
age age was 60.44 ± 10.14 years old, and about 64.29% 
were male. No statistically significant differences were 
detected in neutrophil, gender, never smoker, hyperten -
sion, ALK  rearrangement, EGFR  mutation, tumor stage, 
ECOG PS score, number of metastases, number of pre -
vious treatment lines, previous targeted therapy, previ -
ous radiotherapy, previous immunotherapy and anlotinib 
monotherapy (all p values > 0.05). Compared with low 
level AGR group, patients had a significantly lower age, 
leukocyte, platelets and globulin in the high level AGR 
group. The opposite pattern was observed in albumin. 
In the population with low level AGR, adenocarcinoma 
accounted for the majority, and less subjects received 
more than two chemotherapy lines previously compared 
with those in the high level AGR group.
The univariate analysis of OS
The results of univariate analysis were shown in Table  2. 
The results of univariate analysis showed that female, 
albumin and AGR (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26 
to 0.84, p = 0.0105) were positively associated with OS. 
We also found that age, never smoker, hypertension, ALK

rearrangement, EGFR  mutation, histology, tumor stage, 
ECOG PS score, number of metastases, number of pre -
vious treatment lines, number of previous chemotherapy 
lines, previous targeted therapy, previous radiotherapy, 
previous immunotherapy, anlotinib monotherapy, leuko -
cyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelets and globulin were 
not associated with OS.
The relationship between AGR and OS
The results of multivariate linear regression model were 
shown in Table  3. The non-adjusted model showed that 
for each additional unit increase of AGR, there was 
approximately a 53% lower risk of death (95% CI: 0.26 
to 0.84, p = 0.0105). In minimally adjusted model (only 
adjusted for age, gender and never smoker), the results 
did not have notable changes (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29 to 
0.96, p = 0.0365). After adjusting other potential covari -
ates, AGR in the fully-adjusted model was still positively 
associated with OS (HR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.88, 
p = 0.0230). For sensitivity analysis, we also converted the 
AGR into categorical variable by tertile and figured out 
p for trend. In fully-adjusted model, compared with the 
reference of low group, the estimated reduce of the risk 
of death in the middle and high group were 35% and 51%, 
respectively. The p for the trend was 0.0277.
The analyses of non-linear relationship
In this present study, we analyzed the non-linear relation -
ship between AGR and OS (Fig.  2). The result of smooth 
curve through the generalized additive model showed 
that the relationship between AGR and OS was non-lin -
ear (after fully adjusted). We compared linear regression 
model (fitting the relationship between AGR and OS by a linear regression) and two-piecewise linear regression 
model (fitting the relationship between AGR and OS by 
a curve) (Table  4). The p for log-likelihood ratio test was 
less than 0.05, which indicated that the two-piecewise 
linear regression model should be used to fit the rela -
tionship between AGR and OS. By two-piecewise linear 
regression model and recursive algorithm, we figured out 
the inflection point was 1.24. On the right of inflection 
point (AGR > 1.24), the hazard ratio, 95% CI and p value 
were 0.20, 0.07 to 0.57 and 0.0025, respectively. How -
ever, on the left side of the inflection point (AGR ≤ 1.24), 
we did not observe an association between AGR and OS 
(HR = 13.05, 95% CI: 0.52 to 327.64, p = 0.1183).
The results of Kaplan-Meier analyses
Figure  3 showed the Kaplan-Meier curves of overall sur -
vival in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlo -
tinib, stratified by AGR groups. The median OS in low, 
middle and high AGR groups were 12.26, 14.59 and 20.13 
months, respectively (after fully adjusted). These differ -
ences between different groups were statistically signifi -
cant (the p value of the log-rank test was less than 0.05).
The results of subgroup analyses
As is shown in Fig.  4, the tests of interactions were sig -
nificant for ECOG PS score (p for interaction = 0.0144), 
while the tests of interaction were not statistically sig -
nificant for other covariants (all the p values for inter -
actions were larger than 0.05) ( ALK  rearrangement was 
not included in subgroup analysis because the sample 
size in the subgroup was less than 10). For patients with 
the ECOG PS score = 0, a high AGR was associated with 
favorable prognosis, demonstrating a 77% lower risk of

death (HR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.58) as AGR increased 
by 1 unit. For patients with the ECOG PS score = 1, the 
association between AGR and risk of death had a trend 
but was not statistically significant (HR = 1.52, 95% CI: 
0.42 to 5.48).Discussion
Although several papers have suggested a relationship 
between AGR and prognosis in patients with various 
types of cancers [ 6, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18], this evidence in 
NSCLC remains limited. As we know, our study is the 
first to explore AGR as a prognostic marker in advanced 
NSCLC patients with anlotinib treatment. In the present Table 1  Baseline characteristics of participants according to the tertiles of AGR (n = 196). Values are mean ± SD or n (%)

study, generalized linear model (GLM) and GAM model 
were used to elucidate the relationship between AGR 
and OS. As shown in the fully adjusted model, AGR 
was positively associated with OS in advanced NSCLC 
patients treated with anlotinib. In addition, we converted 
AGR into a categorical variable and the same positive correlation trend was observed. The non-isometric 
changes of hazard ratio indicated that there may be a 
non-linear relationship between AGR and OS. Therefore, 
we further used GAM and two-piecewise linear regres -
sion model to explore the relationship between AGR and 
OS, and clarified it was non-linear, and the correlation 
between AGR and OS was different on the left and right 
sides of the inflection point (AGR = 1.24). This result sug -
gested that AGR was not correlated with OS on the left 
side of the inflection point (AGR ≤ 1.24), but AGR was 
positively correlated with OS when AGR was higher than 
1.24, and for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of 
death was reduced by 80%, which means AGR may be a 
promising prognostic indicator in clinical practices.
Current studies focusing on the relationship between 
inflammation and malignant tumor have found that the 
host systemic inflammatory response and tumor micro -
environment are both crucial in tumor initiation, pro -
gression and metastasis [ 19, 20]. This has also been 
confirmed in lung cancer  [ 21–23]. Albumin and globulin 
are major serum proteins, which can reflect the systemic 
inflammatory response. Albumin regulates systemic 
inflammatory reaction and exert an influence on antioxi -
dant effects. Low albumin levels have been confirmed to 
be a useful prognostic tool for lung cancer [ 24, 25]. Glob -
ulin increases with the accumulation of acute-phase pro -
teins and immunoglobulins, which reflect immune and 
inflammatory states [ 26]. As mentioned above, both albu -
min and globulin could be involved in cancer progres -
sion in various ways and play crucial roles. Based on this, 
the AGR, which accounts for the values of both albumin 
and globulin, has been used as one of the inflammatory 
parameters to assess the systemic inflammatory status of 
the host [ 27]. Meanwhile, several studies have attempted 
to explore the prognostic value of AGR in malignant 
tumors. Our study results were consistent with those 
reported by Suh et al. who conducted a large retrospec -
tive study in generally healthy adults and found that low 
AGR was a risk factor for cancer morbidity and mortal -
ity [16]. Hua Zhang et al. suggested that the preoperative 
AGR might be a predictor of postoperative chemotherapy 
efficacy in patients with stage II and III NSCLC [ 6]. Ping 
Lu et al. also found that the OS of metastatic NSCLC 
patients with high AGR was longer than that with low 
AGR, and suggested that AGR can serve as a prognostic 
tool for metastatic NSCLC [ 10]. Although most of stud -
ies mentioned above have suggested that there was lin -
ear association for AGR and OS, but they did not address 
their nonlinearity, and did not perform the subgroup 
analysis. In our study, we used GAM and two-piecewise 
linear regression model, which could deal with non-para -
metric smoothing and would fit a regression spline to 
the data, to further discover the non-linear relationship 
between AGR and OS. Therefore, the contribution of Table 2  The results of univariate analysis of overall survival

this study was the discovery of a threshold effect on the 
linear relationship between AGR and OS. The inflection 
point we calculated by the recursive algorithm was 1.24. 
The results showed that not all levels of AGR correlated 
with OS. Only when AGR level was higher than 1.24, 
the risk of death was significantly reduced by 80% for 
every 1 unit increase in AGR. This means that only when Table 3  Multiple Cox regression analysis of AGR in patients with

inflammation improves to a certain level or immune 
status improves to a certain level does the risk of death 
correspondingly reduced. When AGR falls below 1.24, 
it may not exhibit a significant independent association 
with OS in advanced NSCLC patients receiving anlo -
tinib treatment. One possible explanation for this result 
is that when AGR is lower than 1.24, it may reflect a state 
of compromised liver function, which is often associated 
with advanced stages of lung cancer. In such cases, there 
are likely multiple indicators and factors contributing to 
the prognosis of patients, and the influence of AGR alone 
may be diminished. Further studies to find suitable prog -
nostic factors in those specific patients are needed.
Subgroup analysis is quite important for a scientific 
study. This analysis will help us to better understand the 
independent association of AGR and OS from known 
risk factors. In the present study, we used age, gender, 
never smoker, hypertension, EGFR  mutation, histology, 
tumor stage, ECOG PS score, number of metastases, 
number of previous treatment lines, number of previous 
chemotherapy lines, previous targeted therapy, previous 
radiotherapy, previous immunotherapy, anlotinib mono -
therapy, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelets 
as stratification variables, of which only ECOG PS score 
was identified. Hence, our study demonstrated that the 
linearly decreasing trend between AGR and risk of death 
occurred only in participants with ECOG PS score = 0 
group. One possible explanation is that patients with 
ECOG PS score = 1 in our study had a higher number of 
metastases (Supplement Table  1), indicating that they 
may have higher tumor burden, which is generally associ -
ated with worse outcomes in cancer patients. And there 
may be multiple factors contributing to the prognosis of 
this group of patients, which may need further study with 
larger sample size to elucidate.
To our knowledge, we are the first to show that AGR 
may be a clinical indicator associated with OS for 
advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. Since 
AGR is a simple, inexpensive and easily available bio -
marker, and is part of routinely administered laboratory 
tests, it is economically beneficial for its widespread clini -
cal application. Despite the above-mentioned strengths, 
there are some limitations in our study. First, this study 
is a retrospective cohort study, and thus, it provides 
only weak evidence of associations between AGR and 
OS; it is hard to distinguish cause and effect. Second, 
the manifestations of possible selection bias, detection 
bias, and analysis bias might be confounded due to the 
nature of retrospective study. Third, as the absence of 
prior research in investigating the association between 
AGR and OS specifically in patients with ECOG PS 
score = 1 group, further investigations to understand the 
underlying mechanisms and determine if this relation -
ship is consistent across different patient populations are needed. Forth, the small sample size may have affected 
the statistical power and generalizability of our find -
ings. It is important to interpret the results with caution 
and recognize that they may not be representative of the 
larger population of patients with advanced lung can -
cer. Furthermore, the patient characteristics and treat -
ment modalities in our study may not fully represent the 
heterogeneity seen in the overall population of patients 
with advanced lung cancer. Therefore, caution should be 
exercised when extrapolating our results to other patient 
cohorts or making clinical decisions solely based on our 
findings.
Conclusions
The relationship between AGR and OS for advanced 
NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib is non-linear. 
AGR is positively correlated with OS when AGR is higher 
than 1.24. These findings further expand the poten -
tial role of AGR as a prognostic predictor in advanced 
NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib.
