He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.

Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot. In keeping with tradition, students, faculty, staff and alumni voted to name the new official

For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events.

	Document Name: The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
	Document Name: MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study.

	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: Carnegie Technical Schools At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that "to die rich is to die disgraced." He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. "My heart is in the work," he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College.

During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were: It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil

	Document Name: About Scotty: About Scotty The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet. Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church. The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni
	Document Name: surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot. In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups. Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage. The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival. The Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects

Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot. In keeping with tradition, students, faculty, staff and alumni voted to name the new official mascot Scotty. But it's not just the costumed mascot that voters named. The live dog is also known as Scotty to the Carnegie Mellon community.

In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups. Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage. The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival. The Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects

	Document Name: About Scotty: About Scotty The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet. Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church. The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni

	Document Name: Tartan Facts - Carnegie Mellon University Athletics: Official Mascot? More than a century after Carnegie Mellon University opened its doors, an official mascot finally made its mark. Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot. In keeping with tradition, students, faculty, staff and alumni voted to name the new official mascot Scotty. But it's not just the costumed mascot that voters named. The live dog is also known as Scotty to the Carnegie Mellon community.

The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) 
degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language 
Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer 
Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students 
with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with 
advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to 
students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, 
programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in 
Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the 
program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and 
students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for 
further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an 
additional fourth semester. 
 
The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations;
	Document Name: 3.3.4 Prerequisite Core Course

	Document Name: Requirements:
The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.

Here are the options:
	Document Name: In total, students must complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.

MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study.

Here are some example schedules for completing the MIIS-16 program.

Example Course of Study #1
	Document Name: The MIIS program will conduct an expedited admissions process after receiving such a request.  The program will explicitly consider whether the coursework done prior to the 
transfer will allow the student to be “on schedule” by the end of the spring semest er, so that 
the student can participate in a capstone project with other MIIS students during the next fall semester.  
MIIS students are allowed to switch tracks (MIIS -16 to MIIS -21 and vice versa) after 
beginning their first semester at CMU. Ideally, all switch requests must be filed  within the 
first semester of the program. It is highly recommended to not switch tracks more than 
once!  Though not forbidden, multiple track switching may negatively impact immigration 
records of international  students. Students also must  understand that extension  of their stay 
in the program will lead to additional financial obligations.
	Document Name: program administrator in early August. All MIIS students are expected to complete all 
assignments by the end of their first semester in the program. Each assignment has its own due 
date.

The Intelligent Information Systems degree offers students the flexibility to create their own course of study in consultation with their advisor. 

MIIS students gain three types of practical experience: software development supervised by their advisor (24 units equivalent to two courses); a summer internship (which can be waived for students that have sufficient prior professional experience); and a capstone project executed in a group of peers (42 units equivalent to three 12-unit courses and one 6-unit course). This combination is proven to help IIS students to broaden their skills quickly. The MIIS degree is offered in two options:

Option 1. Standard MIIS degree (MIIS-16) - A 16-month track that is completed in three academic semesters (fall, spring, fall) and a summer internship.  

Option 2. MIIS: Advanced Study degree (MIIS-21) - A 21-month track that is completed in four academic semesters (fall, spring, fall, spring) and a summer internship.

semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration 
(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in 
consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad 
guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given 
concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program 
is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a 
required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical 
training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the

approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of 
sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent 
of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual 
exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is 
based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade 
or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who 
assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy.

For all LTI MLT students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This support is normally continued for the duration of the program, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, 
and a monthly MLT stipend. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the 
student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns 
more than $200 per month.  
If an MLT student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI’s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, 
the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined

	Document Name: Tartan Facts - Carnegie Mellon University Athletics: Who founded Carnegie Mellon University? Carnegie Technical Schools was founded in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie. Twelve years later it became known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology. In 1967, the school merged with Mellon Institute and became what is known today as Carnegie Mellon University.
	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda.
	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences . In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery.
	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: Andrew Carnegie A self-educated "working boy" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.

	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: Andrew Carnegie A self-educated "working boy" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.
	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda.

	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences . In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery.

	Document Name: Tartan Facts - Carnegie Mellon University Athletics: Who founded Carnegie Mellon University? Carnegie Technical Schools was founded in 1900 by Andrew Carnegie. Twelve years later it became known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology. In 1967, the school merged with Mellon Institute and became what is known today as Carnegie Mellon University.
	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: Carnegie Technical Schools At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that "to die rich is to die disgraced." He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. "My heart is in the work," he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College.
	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: Andrew Carnegie A self-educated "working boy" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.
	Document Name: History - CMU - Carnegie Mellon University: Carnegie Tech – Early Years Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or "Carnegie Tech." During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were: It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil

	Document Name: in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot. In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups. Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage. The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival. The Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression.
	Document Name: About Scotty: About Scotty The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet. Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church. The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni

	Document Name: in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni surveyed thought the Scottish terrier was already the mascot. In the spring, the Task Force partnered with SME Branding — a firm with more than 17 years of experience creating mascots for professional sports teams and universities — to develop the graphics for the mascot. During October, students and alumni reviewed potential mascot images in focus groups. Carnegie Mellon's official mascot debuted at the Nov. 10, 2007 home football game. The graphic features a profile of a distinguished, bold Scottish terrier sporting a plaid scarf around his neck. The dog is contained in a shield, representing Carnegie Mellon's Scottish heritage. The Task Force then partnered with a mascot costume company to design our Scottish terrier in the winter of 2007. The official Scotty costume was unveiled at the 2008 Spring Carnival. The Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression.
	Document Name: Tartan Facts - Carnegie Mellon University Athletics: Official Mascot? More than a century after Carnegie Mellon University opened its doors, an official mascot finally made its mark. Although students have dressed as a Scottish terrier — typically referred to as Scotty — for 50 years, it wasn't until 2007 that Carnegie Mellon officially welcomed the Scottish terrier as the university's first mascot. In keeping with tradition, students, faculty, staff and alumni voted to name the new official mascot Scotty. But it's not just the costumed mascot that voters named. The live dog is also known as Scotty to the Carnegie Mellon community.
Tartan Facts - Carnegie Mellon University Athletics: About Scotty | Celebrating Scotty | Performer Requests
	Document Name: About Scotty: About Scotty The Scottish terrier has long been a familiar figure around Carnegie Mellon's campus. For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events. But the relationship between the Scottish terrier breed and Carnegie Mellon far precedes anybody doing somersaults in a dog costume. Andrew Carnegie, founder of the university, kept a Scottish terrier as his pet. Scotty's road from popular icon to official mascot of the university began in 2006. Carnegie Mellon formed a Mascot Identity Task Force in November 2006, which consisted of students, faculty, staff and alumni. The Task Force was co-chaired by Director of Athletics Susan Bassett and Dean of Student Affairs Jennifer Church. The mascot selection process included a series of surveys and a university Town Hall meeting. Nearly 78 percent of 2,370 students surveyed in February 2007 voted for the Scottish terrier, and approximately 25 percent of 400 alumni
	Document Name: Carnival. The Scottish terrier breed is known for its keen, alert and intelligent expression. Its temperament is described as determined and thoughtful while its physical aspects exemplify strength, power and agility in a small package. Many of these traits are also apparent throughout the university, making the Scottish terrier a natural choice for Carnegie Mellon's mascot. Fun Fact

	Document Name: no Master’s Thesis is required. All Capstone projects are structured as 
research activities and may lead to a publication. There is no Doctoral 
program in Computational Data Science. Because of the highly selective 
nature of the MCDS program and quality of the MCDS curriculum, 
performing well in the program will give a boost to a PhD application. MS 
graduates are welcome to apply to CMU PhD programs but will not receive 
preferential treatment. 
 
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments 
and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies and 
regulations. Each department issues a handbook that informs graduate

	Document Name: 1.1 The MCDS Degree 
The MCDS Degree The Master of Computational Data Science (MCDS) 
degree is a professional Master of Science degree offered by the Language 
Technologies Institute (LTI), a department in the School of Computer 
Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The MCDS degree offers students 
with a Bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with 
advanced study in Computer Science and Machine Learning. We cater to 
students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, 
programming, and logical reasoning. An undergraduate degree in 
Computer Science is not required. Most students will complete the 
program in three semesters; students coming from other disciplines and 
students focus on developing applied research skills in preparation for 
further graduate study or research-oriented employment may require an 
additional fourth semester.

	Document Name: Requirements:
The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.

Here are the options:
	Document Name: In total, students must complete 144 eligible units of study, including eight 12-unit courses, two 12-unit seminar courses and one 24-unit capstone course. Students must choose at minimum five core courses. The remainder of the 12-unit courses with course numbers 600 or greater can be electives chosen from the SCS course catalog. Any additional non-prerequisite units taken beyond the 144 units are also considered electives.

MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study.

The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation (MSAII) program is a successor to the M.S. in Biotechnology, Innovation and Computing (MSBIC). It combines a rigorous AI and machine learning curriculum with real-world team experience in identifying an AI market niche and developing a responsive product in cooperation with external stakeholders. The core program, which lasts four semesters and leads to a capstone project, focuses on both intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship, equipping graduates to either begin a startup or develop a new organization within an existing company. Students will also gain critical practical skills, such as making persuasive technical presentations, assembling development teams, and evaluating the potential of new market ideas.
	Document Name: 8.1 The MSAII Degree 
The M.S. in Artificial Intelli gence and Innovation (MSAII) is a professional master's program 
offered by the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) in the School of Computer Science at 
Carnegie Mellon University. This program seeks to educate students in the innovative use of 
artificial intelligence to create practical soluti ons in a wide variety of application areas. As 
artificial intelligence matures, th ere is a great need for students who can envision, design, plan 
and deliver solutions that integrate AI technolo gies such as deep learning, natural language 
processing, robotics and big data analytics into  new applications.  The program stresses both 
10 
 intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship and enco urages students to develop ideas for startups 
and for introduction into established companies.

o One (1) Machine Learning course 
o One (1) Software Systems course 
o One (1) big data course 
 Systems concentration: 
o 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (elective, prerequisite for many 
advanced Systems courses) 
o Three (3) systems project courses 
 Human-Centered Data Science concentration: 
o One (1) Methods course 
o Two (2) HCI courses

A detailed list of courses satisfying each concentration is contained in the MCDS Program 
FAQ.
	Document Name: The MCDS Program offers a core curriculum and several concentrations; 
students entering the program enroll in core courses in their first 
semester and select further courses to satisfy at least one concentration 
(see Section 3.3.6). Students construct their own course of study, in 
consultation with their academic advisor, in order to satisfy broad 
guidelines. Thus, a student may tailor their coursework in a given 
concentration to follow a particular area of emphasis. The MCDS program 
is typically a 16-month program consisting of courses, seminars, a 
required Capstone Project and a required summer internship or practical 
training. While some MCDS graduates continue on to PhD programs in the 
LTI or other leading universities, most graduates go on to jobs in

Graduate students will find the Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance 
Procedures on the Graduate Education Resource webpage. This document summarizes 
MIIS Graduate Student Handbook  Page 20  
 processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non -academic issues. 
Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the 
applicable department, unit, or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal 
resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow the formal procedures outlined here. These appeal and grievance procedures 
shall apply to students in all graduate progr ams of the University. Students should refer to the 
department specific information in this handbook for department and college information about 
the administration and academic policies of the program.
	Document Name: 3.3.27 Process for Appealing Final Grades  
https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/appeal-of-grades-and-academic-actions.html  
 
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the 
approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of 
sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent 
of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual 
exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is 
based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade 
or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who 
assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy.

	Document Name: 6.1 Graduate Student Funding  
For all LTI MLT students, full funding (tuition plus stipend) is guaranteed for the first year. This support is normally continued for the duration of the program, subject to continuing satisfactory progress and availability of funding. The fellowship includes full tuition and fees, 
and a monthly MLT stipend. In addition, the LTI pays a dependency allowance of 10% of the 
student's monthly stipend to any student with a child, unless they have a spouse who earns 
more than $200 per month.  
If an MLT student receives an outside graduate fellowship (e.g., NSF, Fulbright), the student is expected to accept it in place of the LTI’s graduate fellowship. As an extra incentive to do so, 
the LTI will supplement the award so that the student will receive full tuition and a combined

For years students have suited up in an unofficial Scottish terrier costume to excite the fans at athletic events.

	Document Name: The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
	Document Name: MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester.

	Document Name: Ph.D. in Language and Information Technology
Overview:
The Ph.D. in LTI focuses on developing the next generation of scientific and entrepreneurial leaders. The first two years of the Ph.D. program are similar to our MLT program. After the second year, you will spend most of your time working closely with your faculty advisor on research that advances the state-of-the-art in computer science.
	Document Name: processing, machine learning, and computational biology.  Many MLT graduates continue on to PhD programs in the LTI or other leading universities.  Other graduates  go on to work in the 
computer industry, many at major corporate research laboratories.  
There are significant differences between CMU's different departments and degree programs in philosophical approach, procedures, policies , and regulations. Each departm ent issues a

Courses that satisfy LTI Ph.D. degree requirements may also be used to satisfy requirements for 
one M.S. degree. The most common choice is the LTI’s Master of Language Technologies (MLT) 
degree because its requirements are similar (but not identical) to the Ph.D. requirements. Other M.S. degrees within the LTI and outside of the LTI are also possible.

	Document Name: The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
	Document Name: MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study.

	Document Name: The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
	Document Name: MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study.

	Document Name: The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
	Document Name: MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study.

	Document Name: The MCDS program offers three majors: Systems, Analytics, and Human-Centered Data Science. All three require the same total number of course credits, split among required core courses, electives, data science seminar and capstone courses specifically defined for each major. The degree can also be earned in two different ways, depending on the length of time you spend working on it. Regardless of the timing option, all MCDS students must complete a minimum of 144 units to graduate.
	Document Name: MCDS students must also pass the undergraduate course 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems (6 units), typically in the summer before their program commences. The student must pass with a grade of B- or better. Failure to pass the course means that the student takes 15-213 during either the fall or spring semester. Note that in both cases the units do not count toward the 144 eligible units of study.
